            <p class="lead">This page explains the process of contextualising a field of enquiry- an important step to creating a studio knowledge object.</p>
<h2>Contextualising the field of enquiry</h2>
<p>The first section of a studio knowledge object is where the field of enquiry is contextualised, and this section serves as an introduction. It outlines the particular field of design practice or inquiry investigated in the studio. The design field needs to be described with enough detail to give a non-expert reader a good understanding of the key issues and approaches that your insights relate to.</p>
<p>The context outlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>context/focus</strong> of the design field or studio</li>
<li>the <strong>aims and intent</strong> of this field of practice</li>
<li>the <strong>key</strong> thinkers, practitioners, methods and approaches.</li>
<li>the <strong>implications</strong> of these aspects on your design practice.</li>
</ul>

[Context] The Design for Social Change studio is to design for social innovation, reframing complex problems into practical outcomes that can be integrated into people's lives Working with Oxfam we have had the opportunity to explore complex systemic issues of climate change and food security through design and research. [End context] [Aim/intent] The field of practice explores how design can help make people understand how big problems are relevant to their daily lives. [End aim/intent] [Approaches/thinkers] Approaches and methods used in this emerging field demonstrate ways to promote and support human-centred research and design using ethnography-research skills, and holistic and systems thinking. The studio includes case studies and presentations of social-oriented programs, businesses and NGOs. An 'impact design agency' like Studio Thick works with companies such as Telstra and the Commonwealth Bank that require sustainability and service design to meet their social and community responsibilities. [End approaches/thinkers] [Implications] This field of practice is a way to spread information, ideas and messages to contribute to shaping mentalities and making the world a better place to live. I hope the field continues to develop and become recognised as an actual pathway for designers in the future. [Implications]

[Context] This design studio, Shaping Nature Experiences, provides an advanced level of engagement in communication design for learning institutions like museums and zoos. [End context] [Aim/intent] This design field seeks to engage visitors through immersive and interactive environments and experiences, [End aim/intent] [Approaches/thinkers] based on a constructivist theory of free-choice learning. The guiding principles of interpretation design are to engage, educate and inspire through carefully designed exhibitions. The field of interpretation design is guided by these principles and employs a myriad of overlapping strategies and frameworks. These target exhibition narrative, communication aims and their effectiveness, audience needs, degrees of interaction, and approaches to learning. The frameworks of Falk, Dierking and Adams (2007) aim at allowing the audience to contribute and to engage on multiple levels for an immersive and engaging experience and provide a basis for my design. [End approaches/thinkers] [Implications] As a designer I seek to apply the principles of free-choice learning to exhibition design in order to generate a partnership with the viewer and create a journey through the content that is open to broad as well as individual responses.
