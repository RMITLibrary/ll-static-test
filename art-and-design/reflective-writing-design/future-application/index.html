            <h1 class="margin-top-zero">Future application</h1>
            <p class="lead">The final section of a studio knowledge object speculates about how you can transfer this new knowledge to future projects and professional practice. The aim is to develop your design expertise by applying lessons learned from this studio and from your structured reflection.</p>
<h2>Planning</h2>
<p>On the <a href="../reflecting/index.html"><em>Reflecting on your learning</em></a> page, we learnt about the DIEP framework for reflective writing. As part of DIEP, we need to write a Plan for each of our reflections. Now, in the future applications section of our studio knowledge object, we bring all of our Plan sections together and think of the future application of what we have learnt from our insight as a whole .</p>
<p>To write this section, it is helpful to ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What aspect(s) of the learning in this studio will you draw on for future design practice?</li>
<li>What techniques will you transfer to your future practice?</li>
<li>What meaning and value does this have for your practice?</li>
<li>How might you apply this understanding to your future practice?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's explore how students have used their answers to these questions to write about the future application of their insights.</p>

[End learning] [Techniques] My role as a designer has become clearer through a more profound understanding of the need to create systems and strategies. I have been challenged to see how my creativity and unique way of thinking can be used to create deeper human meaning and connectedness through applying the six spheres of sustainability, using empathy to determine better connectedness, and using feedback as part of the design process. [End techniques] [Meaning/value] So much of my previous design education has taught me that to be a designer is to make things. I no longer think that.

[Past learning] In the Design for Social Change studio I have changed my approach to design from a focus on things to a focus on ways. My role as a designer has become clearer through a more profound understanding of the need to create systems and strategies. I have been challenged to see how my creativity and unique way of thinking can be used to create deeper human meaning and connectedness through applying the six spheres of sustainability, using empathy to determine better connectedness, and using feedback as part of the design process. So much of my previous design education has taught me that to be a designer is to make things. [End past learning] [Future practice] I no longer think that. I feel liberated to know that through these new ways of being, doing and living I can create a career for myself as a designer who can make a difference. [End future practice]

<h5>Questions to ask:</h5>




<ol>
 	

<li>What aspect/s of the learning in this studio will you drawn on for future design practice? (Learning)</li>


 	

<li>What techniques will you transfer to your future practice? (Techniques</li>


 	

<li>What meaning and value does this have for your practice? (Meaning/value)</li>


 	

<li>How might you apply this understanding to your future practice (Apply)</li>


</ol>


[Learning] A critical incident for me was realising that, as a designer I need to be thinking about strategies that have lasting impact. [End learning] When we were first told about our task in the studio, Design for Social Change, [Meaning/value] I was extremely cynical that I would be able to develop a strategy for communicating the importance of climate change and food security to young people. This kind of pessimism prevented me from thinking clearly about how to make a change. [End meaning/value] [Techniques] Taking the time to actually look at successful projects and campaigns that promote sustainable and socially just ideals made me realise that complex design tasks are achievable if we connect the right problem with the right audience in a way that hasn’t been tried before. This is what I learnt from looking at case studies and what inspired my own strategy to use personas and the six spheres approaches. [End techniques] [Meaning/value] Knowing that communicating anything is perfectly achievable as long as you understand who you’re talking to is probably the most important thing that I’ve learnt this semester. [End meaning/value] [Apply] It has given me confidence that this field of practice is not futile and that I can continue to develop my skills in systems thinking for social innovation and sustainable design strategies. [End apply]
