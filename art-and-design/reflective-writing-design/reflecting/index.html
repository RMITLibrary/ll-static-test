            <p class="lead">The main section of the knowledge object contains a series of reflections on your studio learning. Reflections identify key learning and insights gained through critical incidents in the design process and activities in the studio.</p>
<p>Articulation of your learning through reflection supports learning-by-doing and transfer of learning from one studio to another. The aim is to identify general principles from specific learning experiences, linking practice with design theory and methods. It is common for a studio object knowledge assignment to contain three or more reflection paragraphs.</p>
<h2>Step-by-step guide for each reflection</h2>
<p>There are a number of ways that reflective writing can be structured. One is using the <strong>DIEP</strong> framework. Here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Describe</strong> the insight:<br />
First, <strong>identify</strong> what the insight is. An insight is a new understanding that emerged from the studio activities or your design process. It may be a practical, theoretical or critical understanding such as a new awareness of certain factors in the design process, a new method that improves your efficiency, a deeper understanding of a particular issue, a connection between a particular theory and practice, a model that supports your interrogation of a problem, or a framework for evaluating design outcomes.</p>
<p>Then, briefly <strong>describe</strong> the incident that led to this insight. What was the catalyst?</li>
<li><strong>Interpret</strong> the insight:<br />
Explain the connection between this insight and the methods, principles and theory of the design field.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate</strong> the insight:<br />
Make an evaluation of the significance of this new understanding for you. This may relate to the further development of the project or future design projects, or to your design process or the way you think about design.</li>
<li><strong>Plan</strong>:<br />
Make a plan for how you might transfer this new understanding to future projects and/or practice. Speculate about how this new insight might change the way you approach a design task in the future.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Language features</h2>
<h3> Verb tense</h3>
<p>Verb tense is used in reflective writing to indicate what you have learnt from the experience. For example, when you speak about your level of knowledge or experience before the insight, often the past tense is used.<br />
On the other hand, a mixture of the simple present, present continuous, present perfect and future tenses are used to describe your current level of knowledge or experience.</p>
<h3>I, me, my</h3>
<p>In most cases, pronouns like <strong>I</strong>, <strong>me</strong> and <strong>my</strong> are avoided in academic writing. However, in reflective writing you are writing about <em>your</em> experiences. This requires a more personal style of writing where <strong>I</strong>, <strong>me</strong> and <strong>my</strong> should be used.</p>
<h2>Example paragraphs</h2>
<p>The following examples of student writing provide a guide to the structure and language of a reflection paragraph. They highlight the identify, describe, interpret, evaluate and plan sections of the paragraphs, as well as pointing out verb tense and the use of I, me and my.</p>

<h3>Questions to ask:</h3>




<ol>
 	

<li>What insight(s) did I gain through the studio? (Insights)</li>


 	

<li>Which significant events, theories, methods, thinkers and practitioners contributed to your insight? (Methods/thinkers)</li>


 	

<li>What do you now understand and how does it affect your practice? (Meaning/value)</li>


</ol>


[Insights] My specific insight from this studio is that I can use strategy to form an enduring connection with an audience. This is important in this studio because we want to affect social change. [End insights] [Meaning/value] My initial strategy was complicated and unrealistic. I was trying to solve too much. I realised my strategy required a great consideration of my chosen archetype. [End meaning/value] [Methods/thinkers] By building skills in mapping I made very clear correlations between climate change and food security, their current effects on third world communities and the very real threat they pose to our future. Mapping my own connection to the victims of these effects formed a strong sense of empathy and responsibility to take action. Strengthening my skills in interviewing and researching helped me to develop a persona archetype. As I sought to understand everything about them to design a more direct mission and informed touch points, I began to see what could be realistically addressed. [End methods/thinkers] [Meaning/value] I think this studio has challenged and strengthened a range of my personal and professional skills as a designer: how my strategy can appeal to the target audience, how they might interact with the strategy and how I can develop a long-term connection between my strategy and the audience. [End meaning/value]

[Present/future] My specific insight from this studio is that I can use strategy to form an enduring connection with an audience. This is important in this studio because we want to affect social change. [End present/future] [Past] My initial strategy was complicated and unrealistic. I was trying to solve too much. I realised my strategy required a great consideration of my chosen archetype. By building skills in mapping I made very clear correlations between climate change and food security, their current effects on third world communities and the very real threat they pose to our future. Mapping my own connection to the victims of these effects formed a strong sense of empathy and responsibility to take action. Strengthening my skills in interviewing and researching helped me to develop a persona archetype. As I sought to understand everything about them to design a more direct mission and informed touch points, I began to see what could be realistically addressed.

[Insights] The most useful and interesting insight I have gained from this studio is the importance of research methods for creating end-user profiles. [End insights] [Meaning/value] Before this journey, design research (for me) was about making mood boards and identifying basic audience demographics. Without downgrading the importance of these methods, I now recognise that there can be a lot more to research than that. [End meaning/value] [Methods/thinkers] In the Design for Social Change studio I have gained an understanding of specific research methods such as case studies, interviews, customer journey mapping and building comprehensive persona profiles. These methods help designers understand the complexity of the problems and then develop strategies for social change that actually have some validity and meaning. [End methods/thinkers] [Meaning/value] These ways of understanding the user or customer were very helpful in designing my Oxfam Student Month project. I am confident that this new understanding of research methods for identifying and targeting specific users will be beneficial for my future design practice. [End meaning/value]

[Insights] From this studio I have a new understanding of how psychology underpins exhibition design for learning and play environments such as zoos, museums and the like. [End insights] [Methods/thinkers] Throughout the course I was exposed to immersive and interactive design principles; that combine sound, visual, text and spatial elements to create positive learning environments. At the Melbourne Museum and the Melbourne Zoo the exhibitions are created with attention to elements such as: goals or challenges to overcome, stimulus of the senses, feelings of control and minimal distractions. Lidwell, Holden and Butler (2003) suggest these elements are necessary to create a successful immersive experience.Stevenson (1994, p.32) highlights the effectiveness of interactivity to 'inspire and provoke exploration ... and to tempt people to look more thoughtfully' at the displays. Through designing my own miniature suitcase exhibition in this studio, I have gained an understanding of how to undertake integrated design for learning and play. Falk and Dierking's contextual model of learning (2012) suggests that a visitor's personal, sociocultural and physical context all work together to shape their experiences and what they decide to absorb and learn from an exhibition. [End methods/thinkers] [Meaning/value] The idea that the visitor contributes to the learning process, which is a feedback loop between museum and visitor, allows for more flexible and positive, interactive play and learning. Appreciating how these elements combine with the use of different mediums and techniques will assist me in my future practice to create memorable, impactful and effective learning and play environments.
