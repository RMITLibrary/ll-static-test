<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The introduction prepares the reader for your analysis.</p>
<p>There are three main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>General statements</strong> to provide <strong>context</strong> and <strong>background</strong> information, and to show the importance of the work and the reason for your evaluation.</li>
<li>A <strong>thesis statement (argument)</strong> that identifies your specific topic and your position.</li>
<li>An <strong>outline of the scope and organisation</strong> of the essay so the reader knows what is covered. This will be determined by your argument, which you support in the body of your essay.</li>
</ul>
<p>The introduction should also include <strong>key words</strong> from the themes and concepts of the framework. <strong>Key words</strong> should be used throughout your essay to reinforce cohesion and help with the overall 'flow' of your writing.<br />
Use the examples below to explore the different features of an introduction.</p>

<h2>Body paragraphs</h2>
<p>The body of a critical essay should have a logical sequence. This helps the reader to follow the development of the argument, as stated in the introduction. Your argument determines what evidence you select from your research, how you develop your reasoning, and what citations you include to support your position.</p>
<p>Consider others' analyses of the work and identify the strengths or weaknesses of your reasoning. Use evidence to support your views and acknowledge any arguments against them.</p>
<p>Paragraphs are used to group and categorise your evidence. In the example below, note how the linking sentence of the first paragraph connects to the topic sentence of the following paragraph.</p>
<p>Each paragraph should:</p>
<ul>
<li>relate back to the thesis (argument)</li>
<li>describe one main idea supported by information and evidence from your research</li>
<li>use keywords to express the concepts and themes from the framework</li>
<li>use a structure such as <strong>TEEL</strong> to clearly express your ideas to the reader.</li>

[topic sentence]By 1968, demand for changes in social relationships, the emancipation and politicisation of women and minorities, and increasing urbanisation contributed to a global expectation of rebellion, particularly against the social conservatism of the preceding decades.[end topic sentence] [explain] It was also the beginning of a period of intense student activism against authoritarian and patriarchal governments[end explain][Evidence] (Villiger 2013). In the United States, where Swiss Style had become synonymous with corporate America, socio-political tensions surrounding the Vietnam War emerged (Paradis et al. 2013).[End Evidence][Example] Weingart started using more organic and emotional shapes, such as the Issue 11, 1973 cover for TM (TM RSI SGM 1960-90 n.d.c), where the typography is all but obscured by spaces which could be interpreted as bullet holes. [End Example] [Link] The increasing awareness of global complexity and social turmoil encouraged experimentalism and a move away from anonymity to individualism in design.[End Link]

[Link] Weingart believed that for a designer to truly realise their personal typographic ideas, they must first explore all potential design paths via experimentation. [End Link][Explain] However, to do so, typographers needed to understand basic design principles and processes to find solutions to design problems[End Explain] [Evidence] (Heller 2005; Kelley 2015; Schemer-Schebbin 1991). Weingart's philosophy was that designers ‘should be guided in developing their abilities to independently search for knowledge and ...[End Evidence]

<h3>Example 1</h3>


[Restate the argument]Wolfgang Weingart's critical questioning of assumed principles of design remains an important element of a designer's philosophy of practice today.[End Restate the argument][Sum up the main points] As a designer, Weingart has had his work applauded for its break from the conservatism of the International style and celebrated for its individualism. Yet his focus on experimentation and embrace of technology did not distract from his belief that a designer must understand the basic principles of design practice and graphic techniques to underpin their personal practice.[End Sum up the main points][Relate to the broader topic] His more expressive approach to typography encouraged new perspectives and a reaction against the corporatisation of the Swiss Typographic Style.[End Relate to the broader topic]

 

<h3>Example 2</h3>


[Restate the argument] Brasilia was an attempt to advance a nation by rejecting history and embracing new ideas and technologies based on ideologies of a utopian future: making the planned city a useful context through which to analyse modernism and its inherent failures. It is evident that the philosophies of Brasilia's designers, Lucio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer, have led to a breakdown in autonomy between perceived ideas of utopia and the desires of its inhabitants. [End restate the argument] [Sum up the points] The strict ordering and bureaucratic regulations that control life within the planned city have led to social segregation, where people are denied the freedom that modernism promised. The city has been meticulously structured, rooted in the principles of modernism that control any spontaneous event. [End sum up the points] [Relate to the broader topic] The concepts of functionality and rationalism that are fixed in modernism can be useful in planning civic spaces. However, rejection of historical context and denial of freedom of thought of its occupants has led to a refusal to accept these theories as a way of living. [End relate to the broader topic]
