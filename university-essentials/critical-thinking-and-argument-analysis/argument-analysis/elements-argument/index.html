            <p class="lead">Let's unpack some of the key terms involved in argument analysis. On this page, you'll find some of the terminology you'll need to get started, along with explanations and examples.</p>
<p><!--

<p>Contention: The main point of view or opinion the writer is wanting to convey to the reader. This is explored through a range of key arguments each of which will be supported by a claim.</p>



<strong>Key argument:</strong> A key message that a writer wants to convey to the readers to support their contention. The writer will use of range of key arguments to support their contention. The writer will use language and evidence to try to persuade you to a particular point of view.

<strong>Claims:</strong> The key points of the argument. Each key argument should have a central claim. This is often presented as the topic sentence for the key argument.

<strong>Evidence: </strong>information that an author weaves into the writing in order to substantiate claims. Supports the claims and arguments and can include support for the claim, such as examples, statistics, quotes etc. In academic writing, evidence used from other sources must be referenced


<ul>
 	

<li><strong>Strong evidence: </strong>Sufficient evidence, high quality evidence.</li>


 	

<li><strong>Weak evidence </strong>(e.g., anecdotal evidence): Insufficient evidence, poor quality evidence.</li>


</ul>


<strong>Assumption:</strong> Information the writer believes the readers will already know. Assumptions are embedded in the arguments. They are seldom explicit and therefore can be difficult to identify.

<strong>Language: </strong>The deliberate choice of words to influence or to elicit a response.

<h2>Contention</h2>
<p>A contention is the main point of view or opinion the writer is wanting to convey to the reader, usually supported by the claims.</p>
<p>An author's contention is the main claim they're trying to prove throughout their article.</p>
<ul>
<li>Placing their contention at the beginning is the most direct method, and has the effect of positioning the reader to the author's beliefs from the outset.</li>
<li>A contention placed at the end of an article can have the effect of seeming like a valid, logical conclusion to a well-thought through discussion.</li>
<li>The contention can also be repeated throughout the article. The author may have chosen to present it in this way in order to continue reiterating their main point in the audience's minds, aligning them to their views.</li>

<p class="paragraph">The global financial crisis of 2007 (GFC), was a severe worldwide economic crisis so severe that is was labelled as the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression. Yet many economists argue that the problem could have been avoided, if ideologues supporting the economics models of the time weren't so vocal, influential and inconsiderate of others' viewpoints and concerns. As the negative consequences of the GFC unfolded in Australia, key influencers demanded that lessons be learned so as to minimise the risk of such events occurring in the future.

<h2>Evidence</h2>
<p>Evidence is information that an author weaves into the writing in order to substantiate claims. Supports the claims and arguments and can include support for the claim, such as examples, statistics, quotes etc. In academic writing, evidence used from other sources must be referenced.</p>
<p>Evidence is presented in support of the claim and argument. All evidence provides some level of relevance. Always analyse the quality of each piece of evidence being presented to you as the reader. You need to be able to determine the quality of evidence as being strong or weak. Also consider whether the writer adequately presents evidence that contradicts their argument. This can indicate a writer that is present a balanced perspective.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong evidence: </strong>Sufficient evidence, high quality evidence.</li>
<li><strong>Weak evidence: </strong>Insufficient evidence, poor quality evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>A contention needs to be supported by <strong>relevant</strong>, <strong>reliable</strong>, <strong>credible</strong>, <strong>sufficient</strong> and <strong>current</strong> evidence.</p>
<p><strong>If there is no evidence, it isn't an argument - it is only an opinion, a description, or an explanation.</strong></p>
<p>Question the evidence the author has used.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the evidence provided support the argument?</li>
<li>How credible (trustworthy) is the evidence?</li>
<li>Has enough evidence been presented?</li>
<li>Does it come from different sources?</li>
<li>Are there any missing links between the evidence and the author's contention?</li>
<li>Is the evidence current?</li>
<li>Is there other evidence available that might challenge the evidence used?</li>
</ul>
<p>Take notice of linking words and phrases which demonstrate cause/reason, effect/results, to help identify the evidence used to support the argument.<br />

<h2>Assumption</h2>
<p>Assumptions are nformation the writer believes the readers will already know. Assumptions are embedded in the arguments. They are seldom explicit and therefore can be difficult to identify.</p>
<p>Sometimes we assume the answer or reason we have given is ‘obvious' or ‘common sense'. This is because we believe (often incorrectly) that other people think and feel the same as we do. Assumptions come from our personal beliefs and values; they may be justified, or not. Often assumptions are also unstated or ‘hidden' because the writer feels it is unnecessary to explain.</p>
<p>Weak or false arguments are based on incorrect assumptions and are not well-supported by credible evidence.<br />

By reallocating funds from tuition revenue to cover the costs of free education, universities may be unable to provide the necessary scholarships, mentorship programmes, and academic support that are crucial for student retention and success. Consequently, the push for free education could inadvertently and irresponsibly widen the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students, contrary to its intended goal.<br />

<h2>Persuasive language</h2>
<p>Using persuasive language is a deliberate choice of words which are intended to influence or to trigger a response.</p>
<p>This refers to a range of different persuasive language techniques used by writers in their texts to trigger a particular effect on the reader.</p>
<p>Persuasive language includes:</p>
<p><strong>Ridicule, attacks: </strong>The writer attacks an opponent or idea. This is an assertion of the writer's viewpoint, and is used to prove the writers point by using attacking and putting down persuasion techniques against the opponent or idea. These methods are often effective in placing the reader in a position of agreement with the writer.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional language:</strong>: Words used to deliberately create an emotional impact or response from the audience. The effect of using emotive language as a persuasive technique is to appeal to people's emotions and trigger an emotional response.</p>
<p><strong>Hyperbole: </strong>A hyperbole is an extreme exaggeration used to make a point for emphasis. They are not meant to be taken literally. By using a hyperbole, a story can quickly become interesting or sound more convincing. Hyperboles are comparisons, but are exaggerated and often ridiculous.<br />

/* Script to turn on embed mode
// Removes top nav, footer, breadcrumbs, right nav, keywords and prev/next by default
// Options to remove h1, p lead and show prev/next
 Sample query string:
 ?iframe=true&hide-title=true&hide-intro=true
 
 iframe - set to true to enable embed mode
 hide-title - set to true to hide title
 hide-intro - set to true to hid first <p class="lead">
 show-prev-next - set to true to show previous and next buttons
 
 Unlikely hide-title and hide-intro would be used in concert with show-prev-next
