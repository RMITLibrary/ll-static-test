            <p class="lead">So, if I can't just use Google and Wikipedia for my research, then what can I use?</p>
<p>Many lecturers require students to use scholarly or peer-reviewed journal articles for assignments. As a smart researcher, you need to be able to tell whether an article is scholarly.</p>
<p>Scholarly articles are in-depth, accurate, well-researched, written by academics and published in academic journals. They are good and credible sources of information because the articles have been through a peer-review process. This means the article has been formally evaluated by equally qualified academics and experts.</p>

<h2>Non-scholarly information</h2>
<p>Sometimes your assignment requires you to use other types of information other than scholarly resources. Non-scholarly sources can also be useful for your research. They can provide useful information about:</p>
<ul class="red-square">
<li>current events</li>
<li>popular and community information</li>
<li>industry, trade and the professions</li>
<li>government policy and legal information</li>
<li>regions outside Australia, particularly those that are rapidly developing or changing</li>
</ul>
<p>They are usually written by professionals who have specialist knowledge in a field, or by people with a special interest in a topic who have developed reputation for their opinions.</p>
<p>Some common examples of non-scholarly sources are:</p>
<ul class="red-square">
<li>news sources, newspapers, and materials that are time-based and get updated frequently</li>
<li>primary sources</li>
<li>data and statistical publications and compilations</li>
<li>trade and professional sources</li>
<li>audio-visual resources and videos</li>
</ul>
<p>Check with a librarian and/or your lecturer if you are unsure of whether your non-scholarly source is appropriate information for your assignment. You can also use the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/library">Ask the Library service</a>.</p>
