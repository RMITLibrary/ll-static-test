            <p class="lead">There are as many structures for a report as there are reasons for writing one. The differences between reports occur chiefly in the body. This page provides you with information about the different sections that can be found in a report and what information should be included in them.</p>
<p>Reports follow a principle of moving from a <strong>problem</strong> or <strong>issue</strong> through to <strong>solutions</strong>. The structure (headings, sub-headings) needs to be tailored to fit the context (rather than vice versa).</p>
<p>Your lecturer may provide a structure by giving headings or questions to answer. Follow the instructions of your teacher first.</p>
<p>You need to determine the most logical and efficient way to:</p>
<ol>
<li>chunk the information</li>
<li>order the information</li>
<li>label the information using headings or subheadings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reports vary in style and purpose but the following sections are common to most reports. The sections described in the accrodions below should be used as a guide and are not prescriptive.</p>
<h2>Beginning</h2>
<p>Your report should start by setting the context for the body of the report. It is the section where the reader is informed of what they need to know to understand the rest of the report.</p>

<p>The results section of a report details the results or findings of the research. It answers the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happened?</li>
<li>What was found?</li>

<p>There is no interpretation of the results, it only states the facts.</p>
<p>Scientific and engineering reports will be rich with visual data (tables, graphs) and minimal text. Interpretation of the results will be made in the Discussion section.</p>
<h4>Presenting the data</h4>
<p>
              Use visual data to summarise the results and make them easy to understand. Any data that is there to <strong>explain or illustrate</strong> a point should be included in the text. If the data is not essential to the explanation, but  <strong>is supportive, then it can be an appendix</strong> to the report but <strong>still referred to within the text</strong>. Dot points/bullet lists are also useful ways to present information.
          </p>
<h4>Sample results</h4>
<p>There was an 85% response rate to the distribution of questionnaires to new graduates. The results in Table 1 suggest that there is little awareness of the potential dangers of employees using personal profiles and information on social media when applying for jobs.</p>

<p>The discussion section of a report interprets the results of the research. It is here that the findings are woven together and the major issues/themes are identified and discussed. The discussion section aims to:</p>

<li>interpret and weave the results together to show what they mean</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a need for a program of awareness raising among graduates approaching the job market. A large percentage of millennial job seekers surveyed do not realise the extent that their social media profiles can affect their future prospects and such awareness raising could be incorporated into Careers and Employment programs within universities.</p>

<li>how you investigated the issue or problem (method, methodology, materials, participants, length of study time)</li>


 	

<li>what you found through the investigation, (results)</li>


 	

<li>what judgements/ interpretations you have made about the process or the findings (discussion, analysis)</li>


</ul>




<h2>Method/methodology</h2>


The method section of a report details how the research was conducted, the research methods used and the reasons for choosing those methods. It should:


<ul>
 	

<li>outline the participants and research methods used, e.g. surveys/questionnaire, interviews</li>


 	

<li>refer to other relevant studies.</li>


</ul>


The methodology is a step-by-step explanation of the research process. It should be:


<ul>
 	

<li>factual</li>


 	

<li>mainly written in past tense.</li>


</ul>


The method section of a scientific/engineering report provides:


<ul>
 	

<li>an explanation of the experimental procedures (so that the experiment can be repeated for validation in the future).</li>


 	

<li>mainly written in passive tense.</li>


</ul>

The questionnaire used a <span class="method">4-point Likert scale</span> to assess awareness <span class="relevant">(Jones 2007)</span> and attitudes towards social media in recruitment and provided open-ended responses for additional comments. The survey was voluntary and anonymous. A total of 412 questionnaires were distributed online</span> to <span class="participant">randomly selected graduating students from each of the three colleges within the university.</span> The completed questionnaires were returned by email.</p>



</div>




<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="results">


<h2>Results</h2>


The results section of a report details the results or findings of the research. It answers the following questions:


<ul>
 	

<li>What happened?</li>


 	

<li>What was found?</li>


</ul>


There is no interpretation of the results, it only states the facts.

Scientific and engineering reports will be rich with visual data (tables, graphs) and minimal text. Interpretation of the results will be made in the Discussion section.


<h3>Presenting the data</h3>


Use visual data to summarise the results and make them easy to understand. Any data that is there to <strong>explain or illustrate</strong> a point should be included in the text. If the data is not essential to the explanation, but <strong>is supportive, then it can be an appendix</strong> to the report but <strong>still referred to within the text</strong>. Dot points/bullet lists are also useful ways to present information.


<h3>Sample results</h3>


There was an 85% response rate to the distribution of questionnaires to new graduates. The results in Table 1 suggest that there is little awareness of the potential dangers of employees using personal profiles and information on social media when applying for jobs.

<h2>Discussion</h2>


The discussion section of a report interprets the results of the research. It is here that the findings are woven together and the major issues/themes are identified and discussed. The discussion section aims to:


<ul>
 	

<li>state/identify the main research findings/themes</li>


 	

<li>interpret and weave the results together to show what they mean</li>


 	

<li>link the results to other research.</li>


</ul>


Identifying the major themes in the results will help structure the discussion. This will keep the report focussed on specific points that have developed from the data or research. This helps to clarify identifiable outcomes which can often be used as headings.


<h3>Sample discussion</h3>


<span class="color1 color1-h">Discussion of results [1].</span> <span class="color2 color2-h">Link to other research [2].</span> <span class="color3 color3-h">Student analysis/ comments [3].</span>

<span class="color1 color1-h">[1]This study highlights the lack of awareness amongst graduate job seekers of the use of social media for recruitment. The practice of employers accessing the personal profiles of potential employees is widespread and is not considered to be an ethical issue by employers.</span> <span class="color2 color2-h">[2] As the data (Smith &amp; Watson, 2014) demonstrates, over 90% of recruitment professionals refer to LinkedIn and approximately 60% check Facebook and Twitter when considering candidates who have applied for positions. Further, Starr's (2015) research of school leavers indicates that less than 25% are aware of what privacy settings they use on social media and even fewer were aware that these sites may be used for judging people for various reasons (see Appendix 2).</span> <span class="color3 color3-h">[3] Clearly, the job seeking public needs to be made aware that employers are increasingly accessing their personal profiles on social media for recruitment purposes. Educating the public on the consequences of this recruitment practice needs to start early.</span>

</div>




<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="conclusion">


<h2>End</h2>


Reports are often about solving problems or exploring issues. The end of the report should give the reader a sense of outcome and future direction after the body.


<h2>Conclusion</h2>


This is a summary statement of key findings or outcomes. Have your aims been successful or not? Was your hypothesis proven to be true? A <span class="color1 color1-h">synthesis and interpretation of findings [1]</span> makes them meaningful for the reader.


<h3>Sample conclusion</h3>




<div>

<span class="color1 color1-h">[1] Usage of social media in recruitment is widely established and expected to increase as social media becomes further integrated with business and personal lifestyles.</span> Current research has found that over 90% of recruitment professionals refer to LinkedIn and approximately 60% engage with Facebook and Twitter when making decisions about the appropriateness of prospective employees. However results show that graduates were sufficiently aware or alarmed by this practice and the potential discriminatory effect on their employment opportunities.

</div>

<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="recomm">


<h2>Recommendations</h2>


A good way to present your recommendations is to list them in bullet points for easy reading.

What actions do you suggest, given your conclusions? What questions for further study are raised by this research or investigation?


<h3>Sample recommendations</h3>




<ul>
 	

<li>There is a need for a program of awareness raising among graduates approaching the job market. A large percentage of millennial job seekers surveyed do not realise the extent that their social media profiles can affect their future prospects and such awareness raising could be incorporated into Careers and Employment programs within universities.</li>


 	

<li>Awareness of these issues should be introduced in the early years of a course. This would allow students to cultivate career appropriate social media profiles and practices before these issues become crucial.</li>


</ul>


</div>




<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="refs">


<h2>References</h2>


This is a list of all the sources referred to in the report. This should be on a separate page and should be done in accordance with the referencing style chosen by your school. Author date systems list the references in alphabetical order of the first author's surname. Footnoting styles list them in order of their appearance in the report.

</div>




<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="append">


<h2>Appendices</h2>


This includes any documentation that has not been incorporated in the text, but is relevant at some point in the text. This may include:


<ul>
 	

<li>data (graphs, charts, tables) or</li>


 	

<li>other documentation that is too long or complex to include in the body.</li>
