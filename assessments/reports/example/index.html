<span class="highlight-1">It is evident from the results in Table 1 that student mobile phone use in tutorials is considered to be a significant problem; however it was acknowledged that in some cases it should be permissible. Given that such high numbers of teaching staff (85 %) consider that student mobile phone usage in tutorials is a problem, clearly this is a teaching issue that needs to be addressed.<sup aria-hidden="true">1</sup><span class="visually-hidden">Screen reader users, this is an example of discussing and interpret the meaning of the results.</span></span> <span class="highlight-2">Further, while the findings acknowledge a place for mobile phones in exceptional circumstances (62%) it would appear that a policy is required to make explicit acceptable guidelines for their usage.<sup aria-hidden="true">2</sup><span class="visually-hidden">Screen reader users, this is an example of integrating  different findings to create meaning.</span></span>
<span class="highlight-3">These findings are consistent with a number of other studies.

Other similar research shows ….<sup aria-hidden="true">3</sup><span class="visually-hidden">Screen reader users, this is an example of linking results to other research.</span></span>
<p>Another significant finding of this study was that 80% of respondents found mobile phones distracted from the learning environment. This result differs from other similar studies. According to Lau (2011), staff were increasingly using mobile technologies in tutorials and saw them as a valuable addition to the classroom. Further to this, mobile technology has the potential to become a critical tool for teaching (Bond 2010). This difference suggests that the technology can be used effectively if it is integral to the learning process. However, if it is used as a distracting social tool in a tutorial, control of its use is justified.</p>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> [slide 1: Topic slide] </p>
<p> [slide 2: Outline] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> Sitting at the centre of the screen is: “What am I going to be learning today?” The following four words animate in: </p>
<p> - Introduction </p>
<p> - Report structure and organization </p>
<p> - Writing the report </p>
<p> - Business writing </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> This resource covers three important features of the writing required for a successful business research report. Following this brief introduction, the second section covers report structure with a focus on suitable ways </p>
<p> to organize content. The third section outlines the features of persuasive writing. And the final section provides tips for strong effective business writing. </p>
<p> [slide 3: What is a business research report?] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> A checklist of items that make up a research report: </p>
<p> - Formulates a research </p>
<p> - Reports on research findings </p>
<p> - Recommends actions to achieve desirable outcomes </p>
<p> And is written in a </p>
<p> - Business report format </p>
<p> - Professional business writing style </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> This assignment provides you with the opportunity to research and write a real workplace report. It will inform the client of important aspects of their research brief. It will also provide recommendations to achieve desirable outcomes. The report will be presented as a written business proposal and as a presentation. This assignment requires a transition from academic writing to professional business writing. A business research report is written in a professional business style that differs from academic writing. </p>
<h2> Report structure and organization </h2>
<p> [slide 4: Topic slide] </p>
<p> [slide 5: Linear text structure] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> [Graphic] Three babushka dolls representing each of the following: </p>
<p> - Whole text </p>
<p> - Section </p>
<p> - Paragraph </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> Overall, reports have a highly structured linear form with a beginning, middle and an end. This is repeated at the section level and the paragraph level. </p>
<p> [slide 6: Part: 1 - Organising content] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> A report structure should be broken down into sections, having a beginning, middle and end. An example of this is: </p>
<p><strong> Beginning </strong></p>
<p> - Executive summary </p>
<p> - Introduction </p>
<p> - Research question </p>
<p> - Problem, context and literature </p>
<p><strong> Middle </strong></p>
<p> - Methodology, approach and limitations </p>
<p> - Discussion and data analysis </p>
<p> - Implications (benefits and limitations) </p>
<p><strong> End </strong></p>
<p> - Recommendation and conclusion </p>
<p> - Considerations of policy adjustments and recommendations for further research </p>
<p> - References </p>
<p> A numbering system is used for the table of contents, and within them a broad example of a research page appears. Here it emphasizes the use of TEEL, and how each paragraph should be linked with one another. </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> Reports are structured using sections that are clearly organized and use a numbering system. Paragraphs within the sections should be well structured </p>
<p> and ideas should be linked between paragraphs. </p>
<p> [slide 7: Part: 2 - Organising content] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> An example of going from general to specific. </p>
<p> - Current trend for businesses to outsource non-core activities </p>
<p> - Increase in demand for Facilities Management (FM) services </p>
<p> - More integrated and strategic approach to providing FM services </p>
<p> - Business now delivers a range of services through a single contract. These include… </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> General to specific is a useful strategy for organising content in business writing. This is particularly helpful for giving background or an overview. </p>
<p> [slide 8: Report sections] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> [Text] We will now go through each of the report sections in detail: </p>
<p><strong> Example. Report structure and headings. </strong></p>
<p> - Report title and authors names </p>
<p> - Executive summary </p>
<p> - Introduction </p>
<p> - Research question </p>
<p> - Problem, context and literature </p>
<p> - Methodology, approach and limitations </p>
<p> - Discussion and data analysis </p>
<p> - Implications (benefits and limitations) </p>
<p> - Recommendations and conclusions </p>
<p> - Consideration of policy adjustments and recommendation for further research </p>
<p> - References </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> No narration. </p>
<p> [slide 9: Executive summary] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> [Text] </p>
<p> - Briefly summarise the whole report in a logical order </p>
<p> - Outlines context, rationale, objectives, findings, conclusions, recommendations </p>
<p> - Written last, mainly in past tense </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> A strong executive summary is vital to a successful report as it determines the relevance of the report for the reader. It is the section the reader reads first and provides an overall summary of the whole report. Each major section of the report should be summarised in 1 or 2 sentences. </p>
<p> [Slide 10: Introduction] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> [Text] </p>
<p> - Identifies the main context and issues </p>
<p> - Narrows to project aim/purpose </p>
<p> [Text and graphic example] </p>
<p> Graphic of a triangle point downwards, writing from a general to specific. </p>
<p> Accompanying this the following text: </p>
<p> General (top of the triangle): ‘PICA is a property and financial services company currently offering…’ </p>
<p> Specific (bottom of the triangle): ‘PICA requires a business plan for….’ </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> Notice how the introduction narrows the topic from its broader context to the specific purpose of this report. The introduction is written from general to specific, which is a common form found in business writing. </p>
</p>
<p> [slide 11: Research question] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> [Text] </p>
<p> Frames the whole report </p>
<p> [Text example] </p>
<p> This report aims to answer the question ‘Is now a good time for PICA to diversify into Facilities Management (FM)’? </p>
<p> - Sub-questions </p>
<p> - Sub-questions </p>
<p> - Sub-questions </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> This research question frames the whole report and focuses the research to a specific area. It is common to have one research question followed by sub questions and these emerge from the larger question being answered. </p>
<p> [slide 12: Problem, context and literature] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> [Text] </p>
<p> Outlines the general situation in the specific business area </p>
<p> - Definitions </p>
<p> - Competitors </p>
<p> - Financial background </p>
<p> [Graphic] </p>
<p> The accompanying graphic is of the triangle representation pointing downwards from general to specific. </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> Problem, context and literature section of the report requires a general </p>
<p> Introduction to the business which then narrows to cover details of competitors and their financial background. Again you are writing from general to specific. </p>
<p> [slide 13: Methodology, approach and limitations] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> [Text] </p>
<p><strong> How? </strong></p>
<p> The research uses an applied strategy with a change focus (Saunders, Lewis &amp; Thornhill 2012). </p>
<p><strong> Why? </strong></p>
<p> The main approach is data collection will be This methodology is appropriate because…. </p>

<p><strong> Sum up at the end of each section </strong></p>
<p> - In summary, Sydney is well positioned for further growth in residential buildings that require FM services… </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> It is important to refer to your research to show links between the primary research. In this case industry bodies, secondary research such as academic papers, theory and research and your findings. </p>
<p> [slide: 15: Implications: benefits and limitations] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> [Text] </p>
<p><strong> What do your findings mean for the client? </strong></p>
<p> - The findings outlines above suggests that PICA’s desire to enter the FM industry is expected to be beneficial given that… </p>
<p> - NSW trends demonstrate… </p>
<p> - Evidence suggests that PICA will be required to … </p>
<p> - There are risks associated with entering the FM services market. </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> It is important to refer to your research to show links between the primary research. In this case industry bodies, secondary research such as academic papers, theory and research and your findings. You need to explain what your research findings mean for your client. These implications will lead into your recommendations in the next section. </p>
<p> [slide 16: Recommendations and conclusions] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> [Text and Graphic] </p>
<p><strong> Conclusion </strong></p>
<p> - Restates purpose </p>
<p> - Provides ‘the answer’ </p>
<p> - Provides a concluding statement </p>
<p> The accompanying graphic of a triangle representation, this time with it points upward -going from specific to general. </p>
<p> [Text] </p>
<p><strong> Recommendations </strong></p>
<p> - Suggests steps for further action </p>
<p> Eg. It is recommended that: </p>
<p> o PICA should enter the FM market </p>
<p> o Pica should acquire new… </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> The conclusion should provide a clear answer to the research question. </p>
<p> The conclusion is the reverse of the introduction it moves from answering the specific research question to showing how it fits into the broader context. In the recommendation section we return to the steps that this specific business should be taking as a result of the report. </p>
<p> [slide 17: Recommendation for further research] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> [Text] </p>
<p><strong> Outline other research </strong></p>
<p> - Based on the research findings, it is recommended that further in-depth analysis be conducted of the competitive landscape. </p>
<p> - PICA should seek legal and tax advice in order to… </p>
<p><strong> Broadening the scope of the research </strong></p>
<p><strong> Examining certain issues in detail </strong></p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> In the final section of your report, outline what other research you think the client should undertake. This could include broadening the scope of the current research or examining certain issues in more detail. </p>

<p> TEEL can be described using a burger metaphor. The topic and linking sentences make up the bun and base of the burger, and the evidence and explanations make the filling. </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> A paragraph contains one main idea, which is found in the topic sentence. </p>
<p> It is best to put the topic sentence first in the paragraph as this makes reading easier. The rest of the paragraph is made up of explanation and evidence to support the topic sentence. </p>

<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> [Text example] </p>
<p> A sample of a paragraph structure is given using the TEEL structure; each of these parts is highlighted. </p>
<p> [Topic] Leighton Contractors is a large-scale FM operation with considerable FM expertise within its own group of companies [end-topic]. [Example] A brief analysis of Leighton’s focus is helpful to PICA as it considers entry to the FM industry as PICA is considering a similar strategy [end-example]. [Evidence] The specific observation of this report is that Leighton focuses its FM operations into specific areas in which its group of companies has expertise, in particular in construction, telecommunications and mining (Leighton Constractors Pty Ltd 2009) [end-evidence]. [Link] This is a key observation as it affirms PICA’s expressed desire to enter FM by leveraging its expertise in Strata Management [end-link]. </p>

<p> - Introduction and summaries for each section </p>
<p> - Effective evaluation and analysis </p>
<p> - Integration of sources to support your view </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> In a business research report your goal is to persuade the reader to follow your advice. Therefore, it is essential that they believe your understanding of the market is thorough and well researched. The following strategies are useful for writing persuasively. </p>
<p> [slide 22: Strong topic sentence] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> [Text examples] </p>
<p> - [underlined] Evolution consulting [end-underlined] recommends that PICA consider acquiring the Port Stevens Group. </p>
<p> - [underlined] The hypothesis [end-underlined] is that now is a good time for PICA to diversify into FM. </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> Strong topic sentences reinforce your argument and help persuade the reader. Both topic sentences below have a clear direct message. </p>
<p> Notice how the topic sentence comes at the beginning of the sentence. </p>
<p> [slide 23: Introductions and conclusions for sections] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>

<p> - Paragraph strategy </p>
<p> And </p>
<p> - Sentence strategy </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> It is essential to write convincing evaluations of the strengths, weaknesses and risks. It is this understanding that makes it possible for the company to make decisions about future strategy. </p>
<p> [slide 25: Paragraph strategy] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> A graphic illustrating the narration: </p>
<p> At the beginning of a paragraph, the topic sentence (evaluation of risk) should be first written. Followed by an explanation and analysis. Lastly, providing a solution. The language used in the process, should be formal impersonal language. </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> Here are two useful writing strategies, which make your evaluation </p>
<p> and analysis more effective. They are firstly clear paragraph organization </p>
<p> and secondly use of a formal impersonal style. </p>
<p> [slide 26: Sentence strategy] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> [Text] </p>
<p><strong> Use tentative language </strong></p>
<p> This demonstrates you have a thorough understanding of the level of risk. </p>
<p> - It is advised </p>
<p> - Is minimized </p>
<p> - Will be made </p>
<p><strong> Use passive form </strong></p>
<p> Write in an impersonal style. Suggest your view is based on research rather than opinion. </p>
<p> - Could, would, may, might </p>
<p> - There is a view that, </p>
<p> - There is a perception that </p>
<p><strong> Language </strong></p>
<p> Use active verbs </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> In business writing it is generally better to write in a </p>
<p> clear and direct style. This includes using active verb forms. </p>
<p> However, when evaluating risks it is useful to write in a more </p>
<p> tentative and indirect style. Using tentative language shows you have a complex understanding of the situation and are aware of the degrees of risk. </p>
<p> It is also useful to write in an impersonal style as this gives your writing authority. It suggest that you are stating the views of the industry or other experts, and not just your own opinion. Passive verb forms generally weaken business writing as they are indirect. However, they are useful in evaluation as their use emphasises the advice itself rather than the voice of the writer. </p>
<p> [slide 27: Integration of sources] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> [Text] </p>
<p> - Supports your view with evidence </p>
<p> - Demonstrates the strength of your research and sources </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> No narration. </p>
<p> [slide 28: Referencing in sentences] </p>
<p><strong> Description: Sentence 1: </strong></p>
<p> [Source] ACIF (2013) [end-source] projects that recovery will continue to strengthen for NSW in 2014. </p>
<p><strong> Sentence 2: </strong></p>
<p> Recover of the construction sector will continue to strengthen for NSW in 2014 [source] (ACIF) [end-source] </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> There are two ways to include references in a sentence at the beginning or at the end. The difference between these two constructions is subtle but it changes the focus of the sentence. </p>
<p> [slide 29: Effects and emphasis] </p>
<p><strong> Description: Sentence 1: </strong></p>
<p> Source prominent </p>
<p> - <em>Source (ACIF) </em>emphasized as topic </p>
<p> - Common in academic writing where the research itself can be the topic </p>
<p><strong> Sentence 2: </strong></p>
<p> Information prominent </p>
<p> - Recovery emphasized as topic </p>
<p> - Common in business writing </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> This sentence emphasizes the source of the information and is common in academic writing. This does not emphasize the view of the student or writer. This sentence puts the information at the beginning of the sentence and emphasizes the writers view. This is useful if the writer wants to persuade the reader to follow his or her advice. </p>
<h2> Business writing </h2>
<p> [slide 30: Topic slide] </p>
<p> [slide 31: Academic writing and business writing] </p>
<p><strong>Description: Academic</strong></p>

<p> Writing: </p>
<p> - Expected structure </p>
<p> - Business style </p>
<p> - Uses sources with practical application </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> There are differences between academic writing and business writing. In academic writing the overall focus is on knowledge and research. In business writing decision making and action are the goal. These differences are important and affect the writing style. </p>

<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> Iconography for the following three points: </p>
<p> - Be direct: Darts board, aimed at the centre </p>
<p> - Be concise: Cutting out words (paper) </p>
<p> - Use strong active verbs: A man lifting up weights </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> No narration. </p>
<p> [slide 33: Be direct] </p>
<p><strong> Description: </strong></p>
<p> Put the most important information first. <br /> So people can easily find it. </p>
<p><strong> Put the topic sentence at the beginning </strong></p>
<p> [Example] </p>
<p> Whereas in the past, FM services were regarded as an overhead cost, the</p>
<p><strong>[emphasis] attitude towards FM services [end-emphasis] </strong> have changed to now viewing these costs as life cycle costs (International Facilities Management Association 2011). </p>
<p> Versus. </p>
<p><strong>[Emphasis] Attitudes towards FM services [end-emphasis]</strong> have changed from that of an overhead cost to a life cycle cost (International Facilities Management Association 2011). </p>
<p><strong> Make it easy to read </strong></p>
<p> Clear logical structure, headings, sub-headings and bullet points. </p>
<p><strong> Narration: </strong></p>
<p> People are busy and will read only minimally. Therefore, one very useful strategy in business writing is to put the most important information first, </p>
<p> so you know the audience will find it. Notice how the first sentence is more difficult to read. In the second sentence the topic is at the beginning of the sentence as this makes the point immediately clear to the reader. </p>

Another significant finding of this study was that 80% of respondents found mobile phones distracted from the learning environment. This result differs from other similar studies. According to Lau (2011), staff were increasingly using mobile technologies in tutorials and saw them as a valuable addition to the classroom. Further to this, mobile technology has the potential to become a critical tool for teaching (Bond 2010). This difference suggests that the technology can be used effectively if it is integral to the learning process. However, if it is used as a distracting social tool in a tutorial, control of its use is justified.</td>

<h2>Executive summary (or Summary or Abstract)</h2>


[Purpose: The aim of this report was to investigate university teaching staff attitudes to the use of mobile phones by students in tutorials.] [Method: A survey of teaching staff from each college was conducted in first semester of the academic year.] [Results: Overall, the results indicate that the majority of staff found student mobile devices use a major disruption in tutorials.] [Conclusions: The report concludes that the predominant view of staff is that mobile phones are disruptive and should be turned off during tutorials.][Recommendations: It is recommended that the university develops guidelines which would support staff in the restriction of student use of mobile phones in tutorials except in exceptional circumstances.]


<h2>Introduction</h2>


[Context: There has been a great increase in the use of personal mobile phones over the past five years with every indication that this usage will continue to increase. Indeed, widespread use of mobile devices in educational contexts for non educational purposes has been reported as distracting and disruptive to learning environments. Recently a number of university teaching staff have proposed that an institution wide policy be developed regarding student mobile phone use during tutorials and lectures.] [Purpose: This report will discuss research into staff attitudes to the issue of student mobile phone usage in the teaching and learning environment.]


<h2>Method</h2>


[Refer to relevant reading /literature: The research used a quantitative methodology based on the approach advocated by Williams (2009).] [Describe how research done: This study was conducted by questionnaire and investigated university teaching staff attitudes to the use of mobile phones in tutorials (see Appendix 1).] [Refer to relevant reading /literature: The questionnaire used Likert scales to assess social attitudes (Jones 2007) to student mobile phone use and provided open ended responses for additional comments. ] [Describe how research done: The survey was voluntary and anonymous.

<h2>Discussion</h2>


[discuss and interpret the meaning of the results: It is evident from the results in Table 1 that student mobile phone use in tutorials is considered to be a significant problem; however it was acknowledged that in some cases it should be permissible. Given that such high numbers of teaching staff (85 %) consider that student mobile phone usage in tutorials is a problem, clearly this is a teaching issue that needs to be addressed. Further, while the findings acknowledge a place for mobile phones in exceptional circumstances (62%) it would appear that a policy is required to make explicit acceptable guidelines for their usage.]

[link results to other research: These findings are consistent with a number of other studies. According to Smith (2009) many educational institutions have identified mobile phones as disruptive to learning.Watts(2010) also claims that up to 30% of tutorial time is wasted through unnecessary phone interruptions. Other similar research shows ….]

[tip: For Results and Discussion develop headings appropriate for your content]


<h2>Conclusion</h2>


[summary of main findings and 'the answer': The student use of mobile phones in tutorials is clearly intrusive to teaching staff and detrimental to learning environments in general. The study highlights the concerns of teaching staff with regard to mobile phone usage. The fact that the majority of staff views the student use of mobile phones in tutorials as disruptive suggests appropriate guidelines and policies need to be developed.]


<h2>Recommendations</h2>


[suggest possible changes/solutions, point form can be used: It is recommended that the university develops official guidelines regarding the use of mobile phones in tutorials. The guidelines should recommend that:


<ul>
 	

<li>teaching staff have the right to restrict mobile phone usage according to their discretion</li>


 	

<li>mobile phones may only be used by students in exceptional circumstances.</li>


 	

<li>Finally, the guidelines need to be university wide and clearly communicated to all staff and students.]</li>
