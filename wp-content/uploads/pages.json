For this, your marker will consider things like your voice, your body language and gestures, your slides and your engagement with the audience. Here are some tips for maximising your marks for delivery.\r\n\r\nVisit the space before your presentation\r\nIf you're unfamiliar with the presentation venue, try to visit it before the day of your presentation. This allows you to decide where to stand so you don't block the slides and where you can maintain eye contact with the entire audience, not just the teacher. \r\n\r\nIt's also a good opportunity to test the room's technology to prevent any surprises on the day.\r\n\r\nFace your audience\r\nIt can be tempting to turn around and read from your slides, but this should be avoided. Everytime you turn your back on your audience, you break the engagement. This is why positioning yourself to the side of your slides and making hand gestures to important points is preferred. \r\n\r\nAlso, having fewer words on your slides will reduce the temptation to read from them. \r\n\r\nUse your voice\r\nThe voice we use when giving presentations should be different from our normal speech. When presenting, we shoud:\r\n\r\n\tSlow down: This will improve the clarity of your voice by allowing you to focus more on pronunciation and it gives the audience more time to process what you are telling them.\r\n\tProject: This means speaking more loudly than you usually would so that everyone in the room can hear you clearly.\r\n\r\n\tEmphasise\r\nBy using emphasis, you put a stress on key words and concepts, which will make them stand out more for your audience. For example, the following came from a presentation that a students gave on deforestation.\r\n\r\nIn this example, the emphasised words are in bold:\r\n\"Deforestation is a major issue because it leads to the loss of biodiversity and contributes significantly to climate change.\"\r\n\r\nBody language\r\nA good posture and positive body language tells your audience that you are confident, interested and excited about what you have to say. On the other hand, if you have closed body language and do not seem interested in your topic, it will be hard for your audience to be engaged. \r\n\r\nWhere possible, try to maintain good posture, give eye contact to each person in the room and use hand gestures that complement your talk. For example, you can signal to key points in your slides or to emphasise certain key words.\r\n\r\nAvoid crossing your arms, looking at the ground, turning your back to the audience and only focusing on one section of the audience.\r\n\r\nPractice\r\nIf you want to build up your confidence before a talk, then you should know your topic inside and out. Here are some tips for getting prepared:\r\n\r\n\tRehearse your talk a number of times and time yourself. When you know your talk well, you will deliver it well.\r\n\tPractise with a friend or family member and get feedback from them.\r\n\tPractise delivering your talk using the main points and brief notes only on cue cards. It is important that you know your topic thoroughly so that you can deliver your presentation confidently.\r\n","excerpt":"Part of the mark you receive for your presentation will be given for the way your information is delivered.

This means that the colours and styles of visuals and fonts should be uniform throughout the presentation, giving your presentation a cohesive and professional appearance.\r\n\r\nTransitions and animation can add movement to your presentation. However, do not overuse them on your slides, as they can become distracting for your audience. \r\n\r\nWhere graphs and tables are used to represent data, they should be easy to interpret for your audience.

This is called logarithmic differentiation and this module provides an overview of the method and provides some examples.\r\nSuppose you have to differentiate\r\n\\[\\begin{align*}\r\ny &amp; =\\frac{x^{2}-1}{x^{8}\\sqrt{x^{4}+1}}.\r\n\\end{align*}\\]\r\nAt first sight, you need to use the quotient rule. You also need to use the product rule to differentiate the denominator. If you try to do it, it will be a difficult problem. A problem like this can be easier to solve if you take the logarithm of both sides and then differentiate.\r\n\r\n Assuming \\(y&gt;0.\\) Remember the domain of the log function is \\(\\left(0,\\infty\\right)\\)\r\n\r\nRequired background\r\nBefore you attempt logarithmic differerentiation, it is essential\r\nthat you know how to:\r\n\r\n \tUse logarithm laws; and\r\n \tDifferentiate a log function using the chain rule (also known as implicit\r\ndifferentiation).\r\n\r\nThese are reviewed briefly in the next section.\r\n\r\nLogarithm laws\r\nThere are three laws of logarithms that you need to remember. If \\(m\\left(x\\right)\\)\r\nand \\(n\\left(x\\right)\\) are functions of \\(x\\) and \\(m\\left(x\\right)\\),\r\n\\(n\\left(x\\right)&gt;0\\) and \\(a&gt;0,\\ a\\neq1\\) then:\r\n\r\n \tFirst Logarithm Law\r\n\\[\\begin{align*}\r\n\\log_{a}(mn) &amp; =\\log_{a}m+\\log_{a}n &amp; \\left(1\\right)\r\n\\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSecond Logarithm Law\r\n\\[\\begin{align*}\r\n\\log_{a}\\frac{m}{n} &amp; =\\log_{a}m-\\log_{a}n &amp; \\left(2\\right)\r\n\\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tThird Logarithm Law\r\n\\[\\begin{align*}\r\n\\log_{a}m^{p} &amp; =p\\log_{a}m\\,. &amp; \\left(3\\right)\r\n\\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe number \\(a\\) is called the base.

If you discuss a table that appears on the following page, just refer to the table and continue with your text.\r\n \tIf you have a very large table or figure, consider simplifying it to illustrate the key data. Put complex, raw data in an appendix.\r\n \tEach table and each figure needs to be numbered sequentially, even if you only have one.\r\n\r\nTitles, labels and legends\r\nThe way that you provide titles and labels depends on the referencing style you have been asked to use for your assignment. We recommend that you use Easy Cite to help you with this. However, some general rules are:\r\n\r\n \tTables and figures all need brief but informative titles (don\u2019t be creative).\r\n \tTitles for tables are generally written above the table; titles for figures are usually written below the figure (check you assignment instructions for which referencing style to use).\r\n \tIf your table covers more than one page, begin each subsequent page with the table number and write \u2018continued\u2019. For example: Table 4 (continued).\r\n \tLabel the axes of graphs, and of columns and rows in tables, in order to clearly show units of measurement or analysis.\r\n \tUse legends where necessary to define symbols, abbreviations or terminology.\r\n\r\nReferring to tables and figures in your text\r\nKeep in mind that your writing must refer to each table or figure. We do this by referring to them in the text by \u2018Table 1\u2019, Figure 5\u2019, etc., not by their titles. Remember that tables and figures are included to complement the information what you have written in your text, not to replace it.\r\nYou can do this by using your writing to:\r\n\r\n \tinterpret the table or figure\r\n \thighlight the main or important points\r\n \thighlight any unusual or unexpected findings\r\n \tshow relationships between data\r\n \tdraw attention to a relationship or trend\r\n \tsummarise information in the table or figure.\r\n\r\nHere are some ways of introducing tables and figures to your text:\r\n\r\n \tIdentify the table number first and make some statement about it.For example: The data in Table 5.4 indicates that...\r\n \tUse \u2018as\u2019, either at the beginning or end of the sentence.As shown in Table 3.3, student satisfaction increased by 20 per cent in 2022.\r\n\r\nThe number of students who withdrew from their course decreased in 2024, as shown in Figure 3.8.\r\n \tUse the passive voice.Further demographic and contextual data of the PhD (thesis) candidates are shown in Table 4.1.\r\n \tRefer to the table or figure in brackets at the end of the sentence.If the market continues on its current trend, spending will need to be decreased significantly (Figure 3.3).\r\n\r\nTest your knowledge\r\nAnswer these three questions to test what you have learnt.\r\n","excerpt":"Tables and figures are useful in your assignment writing because they can summarise data or complex information in a more readable way.

The phrase is written on behalf of women across cultures who are conditioned to seek approval, permission and sanction from the generic he.\r\n\r\n\u2018he loves me he loves me not\u2019 can also have more negative connotations that signify the trauma of domestic instability and violence. The monumental scale of the installation and the endurance of the task amplifies the futility of continually asking the question.\r\n This work came from me observing my grandmother for years, and one fine morning it was just an idea to photograph her hands because her hands were completely, kind of, they became one with the material and the material became one with her hands.\r\nShe had this continuous movement. It was it was like I was, I will see the in-between energies which were surrounding her hands.\r\nMohammed has been a very important influence; she\u2019s been everything to me in my life and I have grown up with her. It\u2019s been a journey with her, however where she\u2019s been working with textiles and with yarns and with threads all her life, for me it was like part of growing up in that environment.\r\nI work with her fibers \u2013 textiles, which are back in my country, which the craftsmen and weavers have been working for years. The techniques I use kind of, they\u2019re invented by us, so they don\u2019t exist in in like history.\r\nAnd it\u2019s not about the textile, it\u2019s about the language. It\u2019s about an abstract language and trying to communicate through the works, of me wanting to search within the answers which I never could resolve in day-to-day living my life so it was more about me wanting to go within \u2013 wanting to ask questions about living, about life, feelings, the physicality, the tactility of the materials, which we are just not aware, which we\u2019ve lost in our day-to-day livings.\r\nSo yes there is a so the process of me doing these works which made me search, you know, different ways which made me engage with textiles in a very different approach. The work \u201870,000 veils\u2019 has taken seven years to make. Of course, initially I didn\u2019t have an idea what the work will look like or what will eventuate in that time. The work in terms of the process, consists of ten thousand still images taken from my travels of four or five years and then these images are taken and then deconstructed layer for layer to form ten thousand different layers, and then those layers are reconfigured and composited again to form 70,000 veils then they\u2019re animated.\r\nWhat inspires the work: R\u016bm\u012b, Jal\u0101l ad-D\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b \u2013 known as a poet in the West but he was a mystic, a Sufi mystic said, \u201cbetween the individual and the divine there are 70,000 layers and none between the divine and the individual\u2019, and this inspired me and got me thinking about not just from a metaphysical view but also from physical life. I mean you walk into the work; you can choose not to put on the 3d glasses you can choose to put them on.\r\nFor me that that symbolizes life generally \u2013 you can walk through life and have a rewarding life and you would never have to think about if there is anything out there, or you can cross a threshold, a rite of passage and behind the work is all the wires and the sticky tape and the glue and the bolts and the nuts, and the wood frame and so on. Essentially, it\u2019s the workings behind the universe, held by nails and bolts.\r\n I\u2019m very inspired by psychology and cognitive science and it\u2019s a kind of analytic relationship, psychoanalysis relationship between you and the object. So, I\u2019m showing wave of happiness, frustration and paranoia.\r\nSo, psychosomatic series it\u2019s something that you build in your mind and then you react in your body. The idea of the works is to create relationships with people and objects so the objects are in bed with emotions like the happiness or frustration or paranoia, and generally objects doesn\u2019t have emotions only us, and computers doesn\u2019t have emotions.\r\nSo the idea is to create emotions in the objects that are activated by humans so then you could be able to have a relationship with the object.\r\n","excerpt":"A good artist statement communicates ideas with clarity.

They have a max width of 640px, though it is unlikely that they would be displayed inline. It's more likely that they would be floated to the right of a series of paragraphs or displayed in a basic grid using the shortcode ll-grid.\r\n\r\n\tBy default, paragraph text is displayed at small size\r\n\t\r\n\tBy default, a border is displayed around the card.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, headings are wrapped in &lt;h3&gt;\r\n\r\nHeading hierarchy and size\r\nMaintaining a clear heading hierarchy is crucial for accessibility. Headings should start at &lt;h1&gt; and nest logically (e.g., &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;).\r\nBy default, the card shortcode uses &lt;h3&gt; for headings. Depending on context it maybe neccessary to adjust this using the heading-tag attribute.\r\nThe size of the heading can be adjusted using the heading-size attibute. Used in conjunction with heading-tag, it's possible to maintain semantic hierarchy while still maintaining control over the size of the heading itself\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdding images to cards\r\n\r\nIt's possible to add an image before the title by adding in img, alt and attribution-id attibutes. In addition, you'll need to use the attrbution shortcode to ensure the image is probably attributed. Here's an example of both heading alterations and images:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight and wrong cards\r\n\r\nA trim can be applied to the top of a card to enhance visual impact (use sparingly) or, more effectively, to indicate whether something is right, wrong, or neutral. To do this, add the trim attribute to the shortcode with the following valid values: true, incorrect, correct, and neutral. The value true will display the same red trim as incorrect.\r\n\r\nNote: It's crucial to either clarify the purpose of the box in the title (e.g., \"Right: Sentence 1a\" or \"Wrong: Too wordy\") or add the attribute purpose to the shortcode. An example might be purpose=\"Wrong: \". This adds a \"visually-hidden\" class to the title for screen reader accessibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's a neutral example:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFloating cards to the right of content\r\n\r\nThis can be achieved by adding float=\"true\" to the shortcode.\r\n\r\n    By default, floated content has a width of 296px. \r\n\tText is displayed at small size by default. Use class=\"large\" to increase the size.\r\n    On smaller screen sizes (&lt; 768px wide), the card is displayed at full width.\r\n    Image should be placed before supporting content\r\n\tDue to the narrow width, use the attrbution shortcode to handle attribution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe card in this example uses the float=true attribute. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus vestibulum semper elit, non dignissim dolor iaculis sed. Fusce gravida, turpis at pulvinar feugiat, elit tortor convallis urna, sit amet sollicitudin augue ex a velit.

In sapien lorem, tincidunt ut lobortis at, sagittis consequat tortor. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResizing text\r\n\r\nIt is possible to reduce the size by added the class small to html tags like paragraphs. The example below demonstrates this, while also showing cards in a grid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrid margins\r\n\r\nBy default, the grid layout has quite large margins top and bottom. In theese card examples it's rare that there will be more than 4 cards displayed at once, so it may be appropriate to reduce the top margin. To do this, use classes=\"margin-top-zero\" in the ll-grid shortcode:\r\n","excerpt":"Cards can be useful to separate information from the main content flow.

This involves providing feedback on other students\u2019 assignments to help them improve their work.\r\n\r\nWhy are peer reviews used?\r\nThese assignments help students develop several important skills. By reviewing your colleagues\u2019 work, you can improve your critical thinking and learn to be an effective communicator, as your feedback should be given in a sensitive and constructive manner.\r\n\r\nPeople can often feel offended when they perceive criticism. By participating in peer reviews within the safe setting of your course, you can learn to accept and integrate suggestions professionally. This helps you understand that feedback is a collaborative approach to learning rather than personal criticism.\r\nHow are peer reviews used in assignments?\r\nThere are a number of ways peer reviews can be used in assignments. Here are the two most common:\r\nPre-submission peer review\r\nIn some assignments, a peer review stage is included before the final submission. This means that after completing a draft, students are expected to provide constructive feedback on their peers\u2019 drafts, highlighting strengths and suggesting areas for improvement.\r\n\r\nOnce a student has received feedback, they then revise their drafts to enhance the quality of their work.\r\n\r\nThis process allows students to improve their work before the final submission and helps them learn from each other, incorporating diverse perspectives.\r\nCollaborative assignments\r\nIn group assignments, peer review can be used to evaluate individual contributions and overall performance within the group. This peer review stage typically occurs during the assignment process, rather than at the end.\r\n\r\nIt can involve:\r\n\r\n \tFeedback on contributions: Students assess the work of their group members, providing constructive comments on their contributions.\r\n \tA performance review: This may also include providing feedback on their performance and collaboration within the group assignment.\r\n\r\nWhat is expected?\r\nIn assignments with a peer review stage, you are expected to engage actively and thoughtfully in the process. This means providing constructive feedback on your peer\u2019s work and being open to receiving feedback on your own. The goal is to foster a collaborative learning environment where everyone benefits from shared insights and constructive criticism.\r\nProvide feedback\r\nThis involves reading your peer\u2019s assignment thoroughly and assessing it based on the criteria provided by your instructor. You will need to comment on various aspects such as content, structure, and clarity. Your goal is to help your peer improve their work by offering insights and suggestions.\r\nComplete a form \/ submit feedback\r\nWhile you are reviewing your peer\u2019s assignment, you will need to complete a feedback form, which you will often be asked to submit to your class instructor. This form will guide you in structuring your feedback and ensuring it covers all necessary areas.\r\nReceive feedback\r\nThis involves reviewing the comments and suggestions provided by your peer. You will need to read through their feedback carefully to understand their perspective and identify areas for improvement.\r\nAction feedback\r\nhis requires making revisions to your assignment based on the feedback you received. This step involves critically evaluating the suggestions and incorporating changes to enhance the quality of your work.

This page explains how text and images are produced by AI.\r\n\r\nHow does an AI tool generate text?\r\nTools that generate text are a type of AI called a \u2018large language model\u2019 (LLM). They have this name because they are large, very complex computer programs that are fed billions of words of text (a process called \u2018training\u2019) until they become good at understanding the patterns of language\u2014not only grammatical patterns, but also which words and phrases are related to each other and how they tend to appear together in a text.\r\n\r\nWhen you ask one of these tools a question, it analyses your question and tries to answer you based on the patterns it knows. These generative-text tools are based on statistical models of language patterns, so as they write your answer, they are continually analysing probabilities to guess which word or phrase is most likely to appear next in a piece of clear and coherent writing.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to understand that LLMs are not search engines. While they can make it sound like they have all the answers because they\u2019re so good at writing convincing language, they don\u2019t actually \u2018know\u2019 anything. They are simply writing the most reasonable response based on probability. This is why they don\u2019t always provide accurate information, and why some tools are unable to provide sources for the ideas in their writing.\r\nHow does an AI tool generate an image?\r\nLike generative-text tools, AI tools that create images based on a text description are trained on very large sets of data until they\u2019ve learned what patterns make an image look realistic\u2014for example, the usage of colour, texture and lighting, and the way objects are arranged\u2014as well as what text descriptions match different types of images.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImage generating tools can create art in different styles because of the large number of images they\u2019ve already analysed. Just like generative-text tools, they sometimes produce strange results because they do not understand anything about what the real world actually looks like\u2014they are simply mimicking the visual patterns of millions of other images. It should be noted that in many cases, artists have not been consulted before their work was used to train these tools, leading to ethical concerns.","excerpt":"Artificial intelligence can do some amazing (and sometimes not so amazing) things.

This module defines the trigonometric functions using angles in a unit circle.\r\nThe unit circle\r\nA unit circle is a circle that is centered at the origin and has a radius of one as shown below. The origin is the point with co-ordinates \\(\\left(0,0\\right)\\) \r\n\r\n\r\nAn angle measured from the positive \\(x-\\) axis maybe used to define any point on the unit circle. Angles may be positive or negative. Positive angles are in an anti-clockwise direction. and negative angles are in a clockwise direction as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there are \\(360^{\\circ}\\) in a circle, it is possible to to rotate through more than \\(360^{\\circ}\\). For example a rotation of \\(45^{\\circ}\\) identifies the same point as a rotation of \\(45^{\\circ}+360^{\\circ}=405^{\\circ}\\).\r\nAngular measurement and the unit circle\r\nThough angles are often measured in degrees, they may also be measured in radians. One radian is the angle subtended from the \\(x-\\) axis by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle. In a unit circle , the radius is \\(1\\). This is illustrated below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the figure, the red arc is of length \\(1\\) and is the same length as the radius. The angle formed is one radian. Radians are abbreviated as rad or a superscript \\(c\\) like \\(^{c}\\).\r\n\r\nSince the circumference of the unit circle is \\(2\\pi\\) radians and there are \\(360^{\\circ}\\) in a circle we have \\[ 360^{\\circ}=2\\pi\\textrm{ rad.} \\]\r\nThe circumference formula is \\(C=2\\pi r\\) where \\(r\\) is the radius. Since \\(r=1\\) in a unit circle, we see the circumference is \\(2\\pi\\).\r\n\r\nBy dividing the above equation by a number it is possible to derive the following angles in degrees in terms of radians as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} 30^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\\\ 45^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\\\ 60^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\\\ 90^{\\circ} &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\\\ 180^{\\circ} &amp; =\\pi\\\\ 150^{\\circ} &amp; =5\\times30^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =5\\times\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\\\ 270^{\\circ} &amp; =3\\times90^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =3\\times\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3\\pi}{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Angles in radians may also be positive and negative. The same convention is used as for degrees, a positive rotation is anti-clockwise and a negative rotation is clockwise.\r\nSine and cosine on the unit circle\r\nImagine a point \\(P\\left(x,y\\right)\\) on the unit circle as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the triangle \\(POQ\\), the hypotenuse \\(OP\\) is \\(1\\), the adjacent side to the angle \\(\\theta\\) is \\(OQ\\) and the opposite side to the angle \\(\\theta\\) is \\(QP\\). Using the definitions of sine and cosine in a right angled triangle we get Remember that \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\theta &amp; =\\frac{\\textrm{adjacent}}{\\textrm{hypotenuse}} \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin\\theta &amp; =\\frac{\\textrm{opposite}}{\\textrm{hypotenuse}}. \\end{align*}\\]  \\[\\begin{align*} \\cos\\theta &amp; =\\frac{\\textrm{adjacent}}{\\textrm{hypotenuse}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{OQ}{OP}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{x}{1}\\\\ &amp; =x \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\sin\\theta &amp; =\\frac{\\textrm{opposite}}{\\textrm{hypotenuse}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{QP}{OP}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{y}{1}\\\\ &amp; =y \\end{align*}\\]\r\nThat is, any point on the unit circle has coordinates \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =\\cos\\theta\\\\ y &amp; =\\sin\\theta \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle (positive or negative) measured from the positive \\(x-\\) axis to the point.\r\n\r\nExamples: \\(\\sin\\left(0\\right)=0\\) , \\(\\ \\ \\ \\ \\sin\\left(90^{\\circ}\\right)=\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=1\\) , \\(\\ \\ \\ \\ \\cos\\left(0\\right)=1,\\) \\(\\ \\ \\ \\ \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)=\\) cos \\(\\left(90^{\\circ}\\right)=0\\).\r\nThe tangent function\r\nConsider the figure below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe triangles \\(OMN\\) and \\(OQP\\) are similar therefore \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{MN}{OM} &amp; =\\frac{PQ}{OQ}\\\\ MN &amp; =\\frac{PQ}{OQ} &amp; since\\ OM=1 \\end{align*}\\] \\(OM=1\\) (it is a unit circle). We define the length \\(MN\\) to be the tangent of the angle \\(\\theta\\) We call this the tangent as it is the distance measured on the vertical tangent to the circle that passes through the point \\(\\left(1,0\\right)\\).\r\n and abbreviate this to \\(\\tan\\left(\\theta\\right)\\). Also \\(\\sin\\left(\\theta\\right)=PQ\\) and \\(\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right)=OQ.\\) Substituting these relationships into equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\tan\\left(\\theta\\right) &amp; =\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\theta\\right)}{\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right)}. \\end{align*}\\] This agrees with the usual definition of tan from right angled trigonometry.\r\nExact values of sine, cosine and tangent functions\r\nTo find the value of \\(\\sin\\left(\\theta\\right),\\,\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right)\\) and \\(\\tan\\left(\\theta\\right)\\) we usually use a scientific calculator.\r\nWhen using the calculator it is essential that it be in degrees or radians mode. However, there are some special angles that are worth remembering. These are shown in the following table.\r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\nAngle \\(\\left(\\theta\\right)\\)\r\n\\(0^{\\circ}\\)\r\n\\(30^{\\circ}=\\pi\/6\\)\r\n\\(45^{\\circ}=\\pi\/4\\)\r\n\\(60^{\\circ}=\\pi\/3\\)\r\n\\(90^{\\circ}=\\pi\/2\\)\r\n\\(180^{\\circ}=\\pi\\)\r\n\\(270^{\\circ}=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\sin\\) \\(\\left(\\theta\\right)\\)\r\n\\(0\\)\r\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\r\n\\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\)\r\n\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\)\r\n1\r\n0\r\n-1\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\cos\\) \\(\\left(\\theta\\right)\\)\r\n\\(1\\)\r\n\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\)\r\n\\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\)\r\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\r\n0\r\n-1\r\n0\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\tan\\) \\(\\left(\\theta\\right)\\)\r\n\\(0\\)\r\n\\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\)\r\n1\r\n\\(\\sqrt{3}\\)\r\nundefined\r\n0\r\nundefined\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you know the exact values above, you can work out the exact values for other angles using the symmetry of the unit circle.\r\nQuadrants\r\nThe coordinate plane is divided into an upper and lower section by the \\(x\\) -axis. It is further divided into quadrants by the \\(y\\) -axis. These four quadrants are numbered from one to four in an anti-clockwise direction as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowing exact values for some angles in quadrant 1, allows you to find exact values in other quadrants.\r\nExample 1: Find the exact value of \\(\\sin\\left(2\\pi\/3\\right)\\) and \\(\\cos\\left(2\\pi\/3\\right)\\).\r\nSolution: It is important to make a sketch as shown below. Remember \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}=120^{\\circ}\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst draw in the angle you are interested in. In this case it is \\(2\\pi\/3\\) and is shown in blue as are the required values for the circular functions sin and cos.

On this page, we will learn about active reading- a reading technique designed to help you get more out of your reading experience.\r\n\r\nGetting started with active reading\r\nActive reading means making choices about what you read and how you read, and different strategies should be used for different texts. Here are some things to take into consideration:\r\nHave a purpose in mind when you read\r\nSome purposes for reading are learning about new concepts in depth, searching for topics to include in an assignment, and looking for information to support a specific point.\r\n\r\nHow much will you read?\r\nIf the article or book is a core text, then you may decide to read it from cover to cover while taking notes. However, if you are searching for specific information, surveying, skimming, and scanning techniques may be more appropriate.\r\n\r\nHow does it relate to other texts\r\nIf you find that a text has a connection to something else you have read, then as an active reader you would make note of this. As time passes and you read more texts, it is easy to forget this type of detail.\r\n\r\nTake notes and keep organised\r\nActive readers take notes as they read and represent their information in visual ways, such as using tables, diagrams, and mind maps. They also organise \r\nEvaluating the text\r\nGet to know the writer\r\nGetting to know the author can tell you a lot about the purpose of the text. Check their affiliations, that is, any companies, groups or parties that they are associated with. For example, an article written about the benefits of cow\u2019s milk by the CEO of a dairy company should not be the only source used if you are discussing the health impact of dairy products.\r\nThink about the title\r\nThe title of a text can give you useful information about the writer\u2019s purpose, tone, and attitude. Compare the two titles below and consider the information they reveal about the writer:\r\n\r\n    Title 1: The effects of social media usage on adolescent mental health\r\n    Title 2: How social media is disrupting the lives of today's teens\r\n\r\nYou may have identified that the first title is objective. In other words, it does not indicate a bias from the author, and it is probable that the author will be reporting on the observations they have uncovered through the course of their study. On the other hand, title 2 appears to be more subjective, and could be more based on the author's personal feelings.\r\nCritical thinking\r\nActive readers evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the text as they go. To do this, they may ask themselves questions such as:\r\n\r\n    Has the article\/report fulfilled its purpose?\r\n    Is the argument clearly stated and supported by evidence?\r\n    Is the research valid? (Sufficient, appropriate, adequate, objective, valid methodology?)\r\n    Has the argument been developed logically?\r\n    Does it present solutions based on evidence?\r\n    Are recommendations appropriate to the purpose?\r\n    Has the article\/book been published by a reputable publisher?\r\n\r\n\r\nActivity\r\n\r\nLet's test what you know about active reading.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Have you ever read something without really absorbing it?

There, you will find useful information such as:\r\n\r\nthe required length of the presentation.\r\nwhether the presentation should be delivered individually or in a group.\r\nif visuals are required.\r\nif there are any special considerations for the assignment. For example, some assignments require presenters to asnwers a specific number of questions after their presentation.\r\nrequirement around referencing and citation, such as the required number of references and the referencing style you should use.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderstand your audience\r\nThe people who make up your audience will shape what you include in your presentation and how you present it. Some presentations will be for your teacher and your classmates. Others may be delivered to industry professionals. And sometimes you will be given a specific scenarion, such as presenting informtion to the board members of a company.\r\n\r\nWhatever the situation, think about what your audience already knows and what they may not know. For example, for professional audiences, you can assume that they will already be familiar with certain concepts, but for general audiences more explanation may be required.\r\n\r\nResearching\r\nCarefully plan and organise your information. Use the following steps to develop a clear plan for your talk:\r\n\r\n\r\nBrainstorm your topic to clarify what you know\r\nOrganise your information logically, e.g. chronologically, spatially (diagrams and maps), sequentially (first, second)\r\nDevelop a plan. For more detailed information go to the Mind mapping page.\r\n\r\n\r\nWrite and edit\r\n Write your talk in full or write detailed notes. Think about:\r\n\r\nContent: Make sure the ideas are logical and clear. Use examples and facts to illustrate your points.\r\nLanguage: Use language appropriate to the audience and purpose, generally a formal but conversational tone is best (no slang or colloquial language).\r\nStructure: Summarise your talk into meaningful chunks (e.g. numbered or bullet points).

This short video walks you through easy steps for analysing assessment tasks, reading, taking notes, and planning assignments.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlam your assignment: plan it, research it, write it\r\nThis short tutorial gives you an overview of the process of\u00a0planning,\u00a0researching\u00a0and\u00a0writing\u00a0an assignment with quick links to the resources you can use at each stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlanning an assignment.\r\n\r\nWhen you get an assignment, it is not effective just to sit down and write. You need to plan, and here are three important steps for planning an assignment.\r\n\r\nYou need to analyse the task, so that you know exactly what you are being asked to do. You need to read and take notes in an organised way. And, you need to plan the structure of your writing.\r\n\r\nFirst, read the task really carefully to work out what the topic is and how they want you to write the assignment. Here is an example. First, find the topic through the content words. Then, look for instructional words that tell you how to write the assignment.\r\n\r\nNow, think carefully about what this means. Having two instructional words in the question probably means two parts to the essay. It\u2019s helpful to rewrite the question in your own words to really understand it. Getting it right at this point can save a lot of pain later on. Then, you need to find all the information you need. You need to read a lot and take notes. This takes lots of time. This is why you cannot leave things to the last minute.\r\n\r\nRead the general stuff first, and then the more specific. Reading generally is really important if you are not familiar with the topic. Start with books. Academic journal articles tend to be quite specific \u2013 these need some general understanding before you read them. Writing notes is important, too, because it helps you remember. But you need to keep your notes organised so you can easily find information and the sources they come from.\r\n\r\nHere is a system. The left-hand margin is for scanning the page, and if you organise it like this, you can keep a record of your references. Once you have all the information you need, plan by using a mind map. Mind maps have three steps: (1) brainstorm everything you know about the topic, (2) group, prioritise, and maybe even delete some of the ideas, (3) organise all of this and show the connections between the ideas.\r\n\r\nBut the last step in planning is turning this mind map into a linear plan. Work out the structure of the body first before any other section. This can take a lot of thought. Work from big structures like sections, to finer structures like paragraphs, finding the most logical order for everything can be quite tricky, too. After all of this is done, then write your assignment.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Planning and organising an assignment for the first time may seem daunting to new students.

While the basic image mark-up is relatively simple, once options like transcripts, image sizing and captions are used, things can get more complicated.\r\n\r\n\tImage options\r\n\tSizing\r\n\tCaptions and transcripts\r\n\tFloating images\r\n\tPortrait images\r\nMultiple image with one attribution\r\n\r\nBasic image\r\n\r\nHere's the shortcode to place an image on the page:\r\n\r\n\r\n \turl should be an absolute path, ideally to RMIT library's CDN on github. An example url: https:\/\/rmitlibrary.github.io\/cdn\/learninglab\/illustration\/landing\/assessments.png\r\n \tEach image has a margin of 40px applied top and bottom\r\n \tThe default max width for images is 640px\r\n \tImages are aligned to the left by default\r\n \tAlt tags should be no longer than 100 characters\r\n\r\n\r\nImage options\r\n\r\n \tUse border=\"true\" to add a border. This can be useful for diagram images on a white background.\r\n \tUse align=\"center\" or align=\"centre\" to centre the image.\r\n \tUse shadow=\"true\" to add a drop shadow. Use sparingly.\r\n \tUse rounded=\"true\" to add rounded corners. Use sparingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe example above could use more padding around the content to support a border and the rounded corners.\r\n\r\n\r\nSizing\r\nBy default the max-width is set to 640px.\r\n\r\nA range of attributes can override this max-width value:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttribute\r\nmax-width\r\nSuggested use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsize=\"wide\"\r\n100%\r\nVery wide images that aren\u2019t too tall\r\n\r\n\r\nsize=\"md\"\r\n400px\r\nPortrait and square images\r\n\r\n\r\nsize=\"sm\"\r\n296px\r\nReally tall portrait images\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptions\r\nCaptions provide a place to attribute and credit the source of an image. A caption can be added using caption=\"Insert caption here\". Simple html markup can be used within the caption. Elements such as &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; can help with basic formatting.\r\n\r\nIf you include links in captions, make sure you use single quotations not double.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor learning lab, we have a default attribution for use with images made from scratch:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo automatically generate this, use the following code: caption=\"Image title|attrib\"\r\n\r\nLinks can also be used, be careful to use single quotes around the url asthe whole caption itself is wrapped in double quotes. \r\n\r\nFor diagram images where the background is white, the caption can appear too close to the bototm of the image. To alleviate this, add the attribute caption-gap=\"lg\". This increaes the padding between the bottom of the image and the caption. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscripts\r\n\r\nTranscripts are a way to provide an accessible alternative to an image, where a longer description is required that can be provided by an alt tag. To add a transcript, place a &lbrack;transcript&rbrack; shortcode in between the &lbrack;ll-image&rbrack; shortcode. Find out more information about the transcript shortcode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFloating images\r\nFloating images help wrap text around them, maximising screen space. Ensure there's more paragraph text than the height of the image at a screen size of 1400px wide. If this works, the wrap will be effective at other screen sizes too. \r\n\r\n    By default, floated content has a width of 296px. \r\n    On smaller screen sizes (&lt; 768px wide), the image is displayed at full width.\r\n    Image should be placed before supporting content\r\n\tDue to the narrow width, use the attrbution shortcode to handle attribution.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\nThe figure in this example uses the float=true attribute. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus vestibulum semper elit, non dignissim dolor iaculis sed. Fusce gravida, turpis at pulvinar feugiat, elit tortor convallis urna, sit amet sollicitudin augue ex a velit. Curabitur varius sapien ligula, sit amet porta sapien cursus ac.\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus vestibulum semper elit, non dignissim dolor iaculis sed. Fusce gravida, turpis at pulvinar feugiat, elit tortor convallis urna, sit amet sollicitudin augue ex a velit. Curabitur varius sapien ligula, sit amet porta sapien.\r\nPraesent sem metus, lobortis et sapien quis, malesuada egestas enim. Donec ac arcu sit amet ligula pharetra dapibus. In sapien lorem, tincidunt ut lobortis at, sagittis consequat tortor. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices.\r\n\r\nOther float options\r\nBy default, on smaller screen sizes (&lt; 768px wide), the image is displayed at full width. To alter this, there are two options:\r\n\r\nAdd hide-sm=\"true\" to the shortcode. This is only useful if the image is purely decorative.\r\nAdd size=\"sm\" to the shortcode. This reduces the width of the image to 160px and maintains the float across all screen sizes.\r\n\r\nResize your screen to see this behaviour in action on the following examples\r\n\r\n\r\nThe figure in this example uses the size=\"sm\" attribute to reduce the size of the floated image. If you resize your browser window, the floated image remains even at smaller sizes. \r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus vestibulum semper elit, non dignissim dolor iaculis sed. Fusce gravida, turpis at pulvinar feugiat, elit tortor convallis urna, sit amet sollicitudin augue ex a velit. Curabitur varius sapien ligula, sit amet porta sapien.\r\nPraesent sem metus, lobortis et sapien quis, malesuada egestas enim. Donec ac arcu sit amet ligula pharetra dapibus. In sapien lorem, tincidunt ut lobortis at, sagittis consequat tortor. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe figure in this example uses the hide-sm=\"true\" attribute. Reduce the width of your browser window to see the image hide at screen &lt; 768px wide.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus vestibulum semper elit, non dignissim dolor iaculis sed. Fusce gravida, turpis at pulvinar feugiat, elit tortor convallis urna, sit amet sollicitudin augue ex a velit. Curabitur varius sapien ligula, sit amet porta sapien cursus ac.\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus vestibulum semper elit, non dignissim dolor iaculis sed. Fusce gravida, turpis at pulvinar feugiat, elit tortor convallis urna, sit amet sollicitudin augue ex a velit. Curabitur varius sapien ligula, sit amet porta sapien.\r\nPraesent sem metus, lobortis et sapien quis, malesuada egestas enim. Donec ac arcu sit amet ligula pharetra dapibus. In sapien lorem, tincidunt ut lobortis at, sagittis consequat tortor. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPortrait image\r\nWhen using a portrait, the default width of 640px might make the image too tall. You can use portrait=\"true\" to both limit the width to 400px and place the caption to the right of the image. This caption uses html code like as &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; to do basic formatting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing portrait=\"true\" in conjunction with size=\"sm\" further limits the width to 296px. This is useful for really tall images. Note that other size parameters and centring do not work with portrait=\"true\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiple images using the same attribution\r\nMore detail will be added shortly, perhaps on a new page!\r\n\r\nHaving the same attribution displayed multiple times can add unnecessary cognitive load for the user. To counter this, it's possible to use the attribution shortcode and then reference its id in each image required. For each image, add attribution-id=\"my-id\"to the ll-image shortcode. Then add the following shortcode below the images:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe id referenced needs to match that of the images. There's also a default option available, simply add no text between the opening and closing tags:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will produce the following attribution:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are floating images, it's recommended to use this method as the attribuion can take up several lines at a narrow width.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

These require quotation marks and in-text references. Direct quotations should be used sparingly.\r\n \tParaphrasing is the restatement, in your own words, of other authors' works.

His 'idea was to teach more than typography...I had to bring graphic design \u2026 I created a bridge between typography and graphic design' (Weingart cited in Paradis 2011a, para. 126).\r\n\r\n\r\nVisual images (such as a thumbnail images) incorporated into your essay also require a caption that includes the figure number, the title or a description of the work and an in-text citation. Include a full reference to the thumbnail image in your reference list.\r\n\r\nThe RMIT Harvard referencing guide for visual material was used in the examples below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Cover design by Wolfgang Weingart for Typografische Monatsblatter, Issue 11, 1973 (TM RSI SGM 1960-90 n.d.c).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Cover design by Wolfgang Weingart for Typografische Monatsblatter, Issue 2, 1973 (TM RSI SGM 1960-90 n.d.b).\r\n\r\n\r\nBibliography and reference list\r\nYour reference list is placed at the end of your assignment, on a separate page(s).

Learn more about the way universities are structured and the types of study programs that are available, as well as the role of research at a university.\r\n\r\nOrganisation of university activities\r\nA university is generally led by the Vice-Chancellor and governed by the council and the academic board. Each university has their own values, policies, and legislation developed according to the national standards, which they are required to obey and respect.\r\n\r\nAt RMIT, there are four colleges: Business and Law (CoBL), Design and Social Context (DSC), STEM and Vocational Education (CoVE).\r\n\r\nThese colleges are made up of schools. For example, the STEM College has the School of Engineering, the School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, the School of Science and the School of Computing Technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\nStudy programs\r\nTertiary institutions offer a range of study programs from vocational education and higher education to postgraduate education in many disciplines. Here is a list of the levels of education in Australia:\r\n\r\nPre-university study: Programs for domestic and international students to prepare them for tertiary studies or students who require extra support to get into a university-level program or who are keen to brush up their skills before starting at the university level.\r\n\r\nVocational study: Many Australian universities offer vocational education or TAFE (technical and further education) programs, such as certificate programs, diplomas and advanced diplomas.\r\n\r\nShort courses: Some universities offer fully online short courses. The core study areas include artificial intelligence, design, marketing, business and finance, health, science and engineering, data analytics and information technology.\r\n\r\nUndergraduate study\r\nAssociate degrees: Two-year programs that combine both theoretical and practical knowledge, with a significant focus on work-based learning. This is a stand-alone qualification to enter the workforce as well as a pathway to enter a relevant bachelor degree.\r\n\r\nBachelor degrees: Usually three-year study programs with a focus on both theory and practice. However, some professional degrees can take up to four or five years, depending on the study discipline. These degrees are open to both domestic and international students.\r\n\r\nHonours degree: The honours degree is a one-year specialised study that is generally undertaken upon the completion of the bachelor degree. Typically, students are required to have a high GPA from a bachelor to enter an honours degree. With an honours degree, you specialise in a specific area of your discipline. This degree is comprised of a larger portion of research or placement and coursework components. Honours degrees generally prepare you for masters by research or doctoral degree.\r\n\r\nPostgraduate study\r\nPostgraduate studies by coursework: Generally any study done after the completion of a bachelor degree. Occasionally, with extensive industry experience, you might be eligible to undertake a postgraduate program without a bachelor degree. Different levels of postgraduate programs are available, such as: graduate certificates, graduate diplomas and masters. \r\n\r\nResearch degrees: Research degrees are master and doctoral degrees across many disciplines. These programs are comprehensive research conducted independently under the guidance of an expert academic supervisor. You can conduct research as a thesis model or project model, depending on the discipline of study. Masters by research degrees are two years of full-time work, and PhDs are four years of full-time work.\r\n\r\nResearch: Research and innovation are central to university culture, addressing national and global challenges through collaboration with industry, government, and other institutions. Universities employ dedicated research staff, such as research students, assistants, postdoctoral researchers, and senior fellows. Many lecturers also engage in research alongside their teaching duties.\r\n\r\nRecognised prior learning\r\nRecognised prior learning (also known as credit) is the recognition of previous study or learning that can be counted towards a current program.\r\n\r\nThis can reduce the number of units (courses) needed to complete your program, which means the length and cost of your studies are reduced and you don't need to spend time learning things you already know.\r\n","excerpt":"Navigating any space is easier when you understand how it's organised.

Good habits take some time to form and might be difficult at first, until we do them daily without thinking.\r\n\r\nMany of the study habits you form at university will develop in the same way, but they will support you through the rest of your life so it's never too early to explore ways of working that suit you. You'll have a range of class and assessment types, and teaching styles also vary. It's worth keeping an open mind that one way of studying may not suit all classes and assessment types.\r\nSelf-direction, doing it yourself\r\nA key factor in being a success in your studies will be your ability to be self-directed. You may not have immediate access to teachers to answer questions, or there may be a shortage of support services when you need them most. Assessment periods at your institution often mean that everyone needs help at the same time. Organising your time, developing good habits early and having a 'Plan B' for some of the challenges presented will ensure that you're ready for anything.\r\nPulling it all together with a portfolio\r\nA portfolio is a collection of documents and pieces of work that best represent your achievements. It's a record of your academic accomplishments and progress, as well as professional development and reflections on your work.\r\n\r\nYour studies are intended to change you in ways that help you develop the skills and potential to be a success. This progress can be demonstrated by a compilation of your best assessments and related material and activities throughout your studies, providing evidence of your progression and success.\r\n\r\nDeveloping a portfolio like this can help you maintain confidence and can support your learning and capability post-study.

How you work within different class sizes and in groups might impact your approach with your peers.\r\n\r\nGet prepared for collaborative learning with tips at Group work which will help you with completing class discussion activities or assessments when several students are contributing.\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn with integrity\r\nIn tertiary study you are expected to work with a high level of academic integrity. Academic integrity is defined as being when the \"wider academic community is built on shared values and norms of behaviour, including honesty, fairness and responsibility\" (La Trobe University 2023:para. 1). This integrity requirement applies to you as an active member of the academic community. You can demonstrate your knowledge and adherence to academic integrity rules by attending to and applying these points to your study:\r\n\r\n \tbe honest, fair and respectful in all academic activities, from completing your assignments to sitting exams\r\n \temploy good academic practice, whether you are working alone or with a group of classmates\r\n \tensure your work, both individual and collaborative, acknowledges any information that has influenced your thinking. This includes everything from books and articles, to websites and images\r\n \ttake personal responsibility for ensuring you act appropriately in your studies\r\n \tunderstand that these practices are applicable to the whole academic community, including students, staff and other professionals.\r\n\r\nLearn more about academic integrity and RMIT policies around academic integrity.\r\nReferencing\r\nIn tertiary study you'll learn how to acknowledge other people's ideas in your work by using referencing. You'll need to reference the source(s) both in your writing (in-text citation) and at the end of your writing (in a bibliography or reference list).\r\n\r\nReferencing styles vary from one discipline to another, so it's good to check with your teachers which style is used in your course. Visit Easy Cite for a list of referencing styles. If you don't have much experience with referencing, it's good to know that it takes time to master all the formats of your style \u2013 you don't need be an expert right away. Library staff are experts in referencing and can help you.\r\nTime management\r\nIt's common to have commitments beyond studying, such as work, family, and social life, that require your time. It is good to keep in mind that if you do a full-time study load, it can equal a full-time job.\r\n\r\nIt's important to manage your time in ways that can often prioritise your studies, amongst other things. There are things you can do to use your time wisely and keep the load moving.\r\n\r\n \tUse time management tools such as Weekly Planner to control, allocate and keep track of your time to different commitments.\r\n \tStay focused on your tasks by avoiding distractions such as screens and noise (if you need time to read and write).\r\n \tAvoid procrastination. You might think that you can work better under last-minute pressure. The reality is, it will get a lot more stressful when multiple study and work deadlines arrive at the same time. It's always better to plan and act early.\r\n\r\nLearn more about time management.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nLaTrobe University (2023) What is academic integrity?, Academic Integrity website, accessed 07 May 2023. https:\/\/latrobe.libguides.com\/academic-integrity\r\nImages by Monet (adapted), Jacob Lund and Iona on Adobe Stock","excerpt":"You're expected to learn independently at tertiary study.

These skills are valuable for a range of activities, including:\r\n\r\nLearning and development\r\nMost of your course and support materials will be available online, usually accessed through a Learning Management System (LMS) like Canvas. The LMS will offer course materials, readings, video content, discussions, and manage your online assessment. Being comfortable in this online environment is critical to your success in your studies.\r\nYou can use other educational websites such as simulations, learning activities, or the library website. You'll also use digital tools like videoconferencing and discussion boards to interact with your classmates and teachers.\r\n\r\nCommunication, collaboration and participation\r\nYou'll participate in a variety of networks and platforms for work together with your peers. When working in groups, you could use project management tools and shared documents. To share information and participate in discussions, you might use social media platforms like wikis and blogs.\r\n\r\nDigital creation, problem solving and innovation\r\nYou can create digital resources including websites, images and video.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation literacy\r\nThe ability to find and evaluate information for relevance in a timely manner is important. Knowing when information is reliable, credible and suitable for assessments will improve the quality of your work. Navigating online resources such as databases with effective search strategies will help to locate credible information sources. This will enable you to produce better work and achieve higher marks.\r\nMethods to develop your information literacy\r\nWhen searching the web, it's important to think critically about what you're reading. Be careful about misinformation and baseless opinions.\r\n\r\nThere are different methods for determining the quality and reliability of a resource. These include the SIFT and CRAAP methods. Consider one for your practice\u2014they both offer helpful approaches to testing the integrity of information you find online.\r\n\r\nSIFT\r\nThe SIFT (Four Moves) method is great for investigating online content. Its steps include:\r\n\r\n \tStop\r\n \tInvestigate the Source\r\n \tFind Better Coverage, and\r\n \tTrace claims, quotes and media to the original context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRAAP\r\nThe CRAAP method is a checklist you can use to evaluate your source. It explains how you can determine its quality and appropriateness. The criteria includes:\r\n\r\n \tCurrency\r\n \tRelevance\r\n \tAccuracy\r\n \tAuthority\r\n \tPurpose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResearching your assignment\r\nInformation literacy is part of the research process. When looking for information for an assignment, applying these skills will mean that you can find more relevant and valuable information, and this can deepen your knowledge of the subject.\r\nDigital identity and wellbeing\r\nWhen you use social media, remember that your profile can be seen by many people, including future employers. The way that you interact, and the information you present online makes an impression. Be careful about how you engage with online networks, ensuring that anything you contribute is not discriminatory, defamatory or embarrassing.\r\n\r\nEnsure your privacy and security online with tactics to protect against threats like phishing1 and hacking2. Some of these include:\r\n\r\n \tStrong passwords\r\n \tTwo-factor authentication\r\n \tNot using public wifi\r\n \tUpdating device and network security\r\n \tUsing a VPN\r\n \tNot sharing personal information on email or other unsecured channels\r\n\r\nIt's also important that you manage your use of technology to prevent it from interfering with other activities or affecting your mental health. Overuse of social media, for instance, can lead to anxiety, depression and low self-esteem. Engaging with technology in a thoughtful and balanced manner can greatly reduce these harmful effects.

Learn how to design an effective poster presentation that balances text with graphics and helps your audience understand the main points of your work.\r\n\r\nWhat is a poster presentation?\r\nA poster presentation is a visual display, usually on a large poster board, that communicates the key points of a study, project, or topic. It often includes images, diagrams, flowcharts and other graphics, and bullet points are often used to highlight the main ideas. Poster presentations are common at conferences and other academic and professional events.\r\n\r\nWhile your poster might be presented to your peers with a short talk or discussion, the content and message of your poster need to be expressed clearly and concisely, in a way that is easy for your audience to understand without further explanation.\r\nPosters are a great way for you to get your message across with effective visual displays of data and small blocks of supporting text.\r\nAn effective poster is:\r\n\r\n \ta source of information\r\n \ta conversation starter\r\n \ta summary of your work\r\n \tan advertisement for your work.\r\n\r\nGetting started\r\nRead your assignment brief carefully\r\nIt is always a good idea to have a clear understanding of the assessment criteria of your assignment. This way, you will know what the person who is marking your work will be using to grade your assignment. It is recommended that you read through the assignment instructions carefully and highlight keywords and keep these in mind throughout the planning phase of your assignment. You could use the criteria as a checklist when you have finished your draft, to ensure that you have covered everything that you needed to cover.\r\n\r\nAlso, check if there are any requirements regarding the dimensions, font sizes or layout of your poster because if these requirements are not met, this could lead to a lower grade.\r\nContact the library\r\nDon\u2019t know where to look for information? Get in touch with a Librarian through the Ask the Library chat service.\r\n\r\nThey can help you find the best search terms to use, show you how to filter results, and help you identify which databases to use for your subject area.\r\nKnow your audience\r\nThink about who it is that you will present the information to. Are they professionals in your field? Are they members of the general public?\r\n\r\nUnderstanding your audience will help you to decide what content to include and the language you should use to communicate your work. Technical language and excessive jargon is not always appropriate for every assignment. Ensure that your message is clearly communicated to the target audience.\r\nWhat to include\r\nThis will depend on the purpose of your poster. For example, are you telling an audience about research that you conducted? You might decide that your audience needs to know why you conducted the research, how you did it, who participated in it, what the results were and what the implications of the results are.\r\n\r\nIn this case, you might decide to follow a typical report structure of an introduction, methods, results, conclusion and discussion sections. For another type of project, you may need to include a literature review section or recommendations. And don\u2019t forget to include your references.\r\n\r\nIf you are confused about how to structure your work, you can contact an Academic Skills Advisor through the Ask the Library service to get some feedback and advice.\r\nDesign\r\nCarefully consider the design of your poster, as this will affect how your audience engages with your information. Remember that you should include a mixture of writing and visual aids such as images, graphs, tables and charts. Your poster should be sized roughly at A0 size (841 x 1189 mm).\r\nOverall appearance\r\nYour poster should be neat and uncluttered.\r\n\r\n \tUse a pleasing arrangement of graphics, text, colours.\r\n \tOrganise sections by using white space.\r\n \tBalance the placement of text and figures.\r\n\r\nUse headings to help readers find what they\u2019re looking for: objective, results, conclusions, etc.\r\n\r\n \tMinimise text \u2013 use graphics.\r\n \tKeep text in blocks of no more than 50-75 words \u2013 don\u2019t create large, monolithic paragraphs.\r\n \tUse a columnar format.\r\n\r\nConsider text size.\r\n\r\n \tAll text should be large enough to read from 1\u20132 metres, including the text in figures.\r\n \tTitle should be larger, to attract attention from far away.\r\n \tContent should be written from top to bottom (first) and left to right.\r\n\r\nUse colour cautiously.\r\n\r\n \tDark letters on light background are easiest to read.\r\n \tStick to a theme of 2\u20133 colours.\r\n \tAvoid overly bright colours. They attract attention but wear out readers\u2019 eyes.\r\n\r\nInclude full contact information. You want to be found \u2013 the reader should not have to look up anything to find you.\r\nLayout\r\n\r\n \tConsider whether your poster would be best in landscape or portrait orientation.\r\n \tYour information should flow in a logical way, e.g., left to right, from the centre outwards, or in columns.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n \tMake sure that your poster is not overcrowded. There should be space around each section, as this will increase the readability of your work.\r\n \tInclude a border of 3cm around your poster.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nImages\r\nPart of your message will be conveyed through images, so they should be chosen carefully.\r\n\r\nAlways add citations, attributions and captions to images. If you are not sure how to properly cite an image or include a caption, visit Easy Cite for guidance on a variety of referencing styles.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember, you can't include everything in your poster. Choose the most important data, graphs, and images to include. You can expand upon your poster in an accompanying presentation.\r\n\r\nAvoid overly complicated graphs, charts or tables. Rather, aim to include graphic information that is clear and easy to understand. Focus on relationships \u2013 exact values are usually less important.\r\n\r\n \tKeep the focus on data.\r\n \tGrid lines, detailed ticks on axes, data markers, and backgrounds are often not needed.\r\n \tLabel data directly, when possible. Legends force readers to look back and forth to decode the graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInclude a title that stands out and catches your audience\u2019s attention. In physical settings, your title should be able to be read from 2-3 metres away.\r\n\r\nFor font sizes, it is recommended that you use:\r\n\r\n \t80-96 for titles\r\n \t30-36 for headings\r\n \t18-24 for body text\r\n\r\nOther factors to consider are:\r\n\r\n \tWhere possible, use bullet points to make your text more concise and help your reader to focus on the main ideas of your poster.\r\n \tChoose your text and background colours carefully to ensure that your work is readable.\r\n\r\n \tDon't use decorative or overly stylised fonts such as Comic Sans, as they are not considered academic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnology\r\nThere are many apps and programs that can help you to design and create your poster. They include:\r\n\r\n \tMicrosoft PowerPoint\r\n \tCanva\r\n \tAdobe Illustrator\r\n \tAdobe InDesign\r\n \tMicrosoft Publisher\r\n\r\nThey each have their pros and cons, so it is recommended that you try a few and see what works best for you. Some free software and apps are available for RMIT students.\r\n\r\nOnce you have made your first successful poster presentation, especially if you receive good feedback for it, you can use it as a template for future presentations.\r\nAcademic writing\r\nIt is highly likely that your tutor or lecturer will request that you follow academic style conventions in your poster, such as avoiding personal pronouns and contractions, and using formal language. For help with academic style, you can make an appointment with an Academic Skills Advisor to review your work and get advice.\r\nPresenting your poster\r\nYou may be asked to \"walk\" people through your poster, that is, to prepare a 3\u20135 minute verbal explanation of your work.\r\n\r\nWhen giving your presentation, don't just read the poster from top to bottom. Instead:\r\n\r\n \tgive the big picture,\r\n \texplain why the problem is important, and\r\n \texplain how the graphics on your poster illustrate and support your findings and recommendations.\r\n\r\nA summary handout is something you can refer to when talking to people about your work. Prepare a handout that provides a written record for readers. You want people to remember your work. You can include:\r\n\r\n \ta miniature version of your poster\r\n \tmore detailed graphics, tables, and text explanations\r\n \tcomplete contact information.\r\n","excerpt":"Depending on your program of study, you might be asked to create a poster presentation as part of an assessment.

A successful paraphrase changes both the structure and words of the original text.\r\nIt usually isn\u2019t necessary, or desirable, to quote the exact words of another author. Instead, you can explain their work or ideas in your own words, and relate the information to the argument that you are developing. Expressing someone else\u2019s ideas in your own words is called paraphrasing.\r\nWhat is paraphrasing?\r\nThe goal of paraphrasing is to re-state information in your own words. A paraphrase is usually based on a small section of text, as opposed to a summary, which contains the main points of a larger work.\r\n\r\nA successful paraphrase keeps the original meaning of the source material, but uses different vocabulary and sentence structure to express that meaning. Paraphrasing can be a useful way of explaining complex information in simpler language. Sometimes this means that paraphrases are actually longer than the source material.\r\nHow to paraphrase successfully\r\nTo paraphrase a text, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n \tRead or listen to the text that you want to paraphrase and make sure you understand the main idea.\r\nExample of original (fictional) text\r\nAfter the cultural awareness intervention, the experimental group demonstrated growth in the target areas at a statistically significant level, while the control group showed no gains.\r\n\r\n \tWrite the idea from memory. Try switching the concepts around and start your explanation of the idea in a different place. You might imagine that you are trying to explain the idea to someone who didn\u2019t understand the original text.\r\nFirst paraphrase attempt\r\nWhile the students in the control group did not have any gains, students in the experimental group who experienced the cultural awareness intervention demonstrated significant improvements (Author 2023).\r\n\r\n \tIf you\u2019ve used too many words that are similar to the original text, replace these words with other words or phrases of similar meaning. A thesaurus or dictionary can help you, as can academic word lists that offer different word forms. A good goal is to aim for no more than 4 words in a row that are the same as in the original source.\r\nFinal paraphrase\r\nWhile the students in the control group of Author\u2019s (2023) study remained at the same levels of cultural awareness, those students who participated in the additional experimental classroom activities improved their cultural awareness by a large margin.\r\n\r\n \tCompare your language to the original text to make sure your version is different, but that you\u2019ve kept the original idea. Don\u2019t forget that you need to include a citation every time you paraphrase.\r\n\r\nAvoiding plagiarism\r\nIt is important paraphrase correctly to avoid plagiarism. If you use a section of text from another source in your own work, and you only change a few words or move the sentences around, that is still considered plagiarism. A paraphrase needs to be significantly different in vocabulary and structure to the original text. Plagiarism-detection tools like Turnitin will flag text for plagiarism if it's too similar to another person\u2019s work, even if some of the words have been changed.\r\n\r\nNew artificial intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT, have the ability to paraphrase information, but words taken from ChatGPT also need to be properly referenced. The use of these tools is not always permitted, so be sure you understand the expectations of your course to avoid academic misconduct, and check with your instructor if you have any questions.\r\nPractice paraphrasing\r\nRead the text below, and then select the best paraphrase from the two options given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note: The examples on this page use the RMIT Harvard referencing style.

As a student at RMIT, you are responsible for upholding the academic integrity of the university.\r\n\r\nWhat is academic integrity?\r\nUnderstanding academic integrity will help you succeed as a member of the RMIT academic community.\r\n\"Academic integrity means acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research. It is important for students, teachers, researchers and professional staff to act in an honest way, be responsible for their actions, and show fairness in every part of their work. All students and staff should be an example to others of how to act with integrity in their study and work.\u201d (Exemplary Academic Integrity Project, 2013).\r\nPlay the video for a brief overview of academic integrity:\r\n\r\nUnderstanding academic misconduct\r\nIt is important to understand what academic misconduct is in order to avoid it. The four main forms of academic misconduct are:\r\n\r\n \tCollusion \u2013 working with others to do an assessment that was meant to be completed individually\r\n \tImproper exam conduct \u2013 giving or receiving help during exams, including using prohibited technology or tools.\r\n \tGhostwriting and contract cheating \u2013 having someone else complete an assessment for you, or completing someone else\u2019s assessment\r\n \tPlagiarism \u2013 using someone else\u2019s work or ideas without giving them proper credit\r\n\r\nAcademic integrity in Australia\r\nAcademic integrity is taken very seriously in Australia, and there have even been people who have had their degrees withdrawn, after graduation, when they were found to have cheated.\r\n\r\nTertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) is the federal government agency responsible for standards in tertiary education. TEQSA enforces regulations relating to universities, including academic integrity. In fact, contract cheating services\u2014companies that charge students money to write their assessments for them\u2014are illegal thanks to TEQSA. Not only is it illegal to take money to do someone else\u2019s assessments, it is illegal to buy an essay or other assignment from anyone.\r\n\r\nTEQSA has resources for students, and they also provide information in languages other than English.\r\n\r\nStudents need to be aware of the requirements for their studies. This includes knowing what is considered cheating or colluding, and what is acceptable practice. When in doubt, your instructor can answer questions about what is expected in your course.\r\nReferences\r\nExemplary Academic Integrity Project, (2023).

This includes doing your own original work, respecting and acknowledging the work of other people, and clearly stating when you use someone else's ideas, words or images by citing correctly in the body of your work and referencing your sources accurately.\r\n\r\nAcademic integrity involves recognising people and publications that have influenced your thinking and taking personal responsibility for the way you behave in an academic context. It's important to complete individual assignments on your own or acknowledge who you work with in group assignments. You should always behave with integrity in exams and assessments.\r\n\r\nFailing to recognise someone else\u2019s ideas by: not referencing, dishonestly working with another student on an individual assignment, or cheating on an exam or assignment, can result in a charge of Academic Misconduct. Other examples include paying or asking someone to write an assignment for you or attempting to bribe someone in the academic community.\r\n\r\nAcademic Misconduct can have serious consequences for both your academic and professional career. In some academic cultures, copying content may be seen as honouring the creator. However, at RMIT you must clearly state where ideas, words and images originated because they belong to the person or people who created them.\r\n\r\nEveryone has a responsibility for maintaining academic integrity, but don't worry, there's lots of support available. You can ask your tutor or lecturer to clarify the task. You can also take your assignment to the study support hub for extra help or use the Ask the Library online chat service. While they can\u2019t write the content for you, they can help you with structure and grammar.\r\n\r\nBy strengthening your understanding of academic integrity, you can develop skills which will be valuable throughout your work and life.","excerpt":"Just as all communities have accepted standards for behaviour, academic communities expect members to act with academic integrity.

It's considered a form of theft, because the work doesn't belong to you. It's also fraud, because it means you are claiming someone else\u2019s work or ideas as your own.\r\n\r\nIn short, any time you use the ideas of others in your own work, ensure you reference them properly.\r\nTypes of plagiarism\r\n\r\nIntentional plagiarism\r\nIntentional plagiarism is deliberately using someone else\u2019s ideas, words or images and presenting them as your own. This includes using paraphrasing or translation software to change materials without acknowledging the sources. Intentional plagiarism is theft and fraud, and has serious consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental plagiarism\r\nAccidental plagiarism is when you do not reference sources correctly in an assignment. This usually happens when students haven't carefully noted their sources as they work. While accidental plagiarism might not be intended, it can still carry negative academic consequences. Visit the Referencing section to learn more.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf plagiarism\r\nUsing parts of your old assignments in new assignments without referencing is self-plagiarism. Many courses do not allow self-referencing, but if you are permitted to use parts of your old assignments, make sure you reference them the same way you would reference any other source.\r\nAvoiding plagiarism\r\nFollow the steps below to help avoid accidental plagiarism:\r\n\r\n \tAccurately write down details of authors when taking notes.\r\n \tParaphrase carefully.\r\n \tBe accurate with citations and quotes.\r\n \tCheck your reference list is complete.\r\n \tProofread your work for citation and referencing errors.\r\n\r\nQuiz: Is it plagiarism?\r\nTake this quiz to test your knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"You wouldn\u2019t want someone else taking credit for your hard work\u2014which is why it\u2019s important to always give credit when using someone else\u2019s ideas.

Learn more about the feedback provided by Turnitin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you submit your work to Turnitin, a similarity report will be generated. Your instructor will review this report to help them determine whether you have referenced everything correctly, or whether you might have plagiarised. \r\nUnderstanding the similarity report\r\nThe similarity report shows the amount of text that matches other texts, including websites, academic journals, and material previously uploaded to Turnitin. This may include work that you've submitted to RMIT in the past, as well as assignments from other institutions around the world.\r\n\r\nThe similarity report will tell you the percentage of your text that matches other materials. The match overview section highlights parts of text that match or are very similar to sources already on Turnitin. How the text matches are spread out is more important than the percentage. If you have large chunks of text which are highlighted, this could mean that more careful paraphrasing is needed. In some cases, you can make changes and upload your work again to produce a new similarity report. Check your course guide on Canvas to see if you can do this.\r\n\r\nIf there are small matches, look at these carefully. Correctly cited and formatted quotes may be highlighted, depending on the Turnitin settings. Additionally, items such as course titles, teacher names, and assignment titles may be highlighted in Turnitin.\r\nReducing the similarity score\r\nThese tips can help you reduce your similarity score:\r\n\r\n \tIf chunks of text are highlighted, then you need to paraphrase further as the wording is still too close to the original source.\r\n \tCheck that your quotations have double quotation marks. Single marks will always be ignored by Turnitin.\r\n \tCheck the settings. You can reduce the percentage immediately by excluding quotations and your reference list. Note that changing the settings does not impact what your instructor sees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTurnitin is text-matching software. It\u2019s used to detect plagiarism in written assignments submitted online. It scans everything that\u2019s been uploaded for text matches. If something is copied from another source and it\u2019s not cited correctly, it will be detected. The reason RMIT uses Turnitin is to ensure academic integrity. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important that any written work is your own or that you acknowledge that it has come from another source. Turnitin works by matching the text in assignments against electronic, print and other sources. This includes books and journals, websites, archived materials, and other students\u2019 assignments, from global universities. It detects incorrect citations and both accidental and intentional plagiarism. Turnitin makes sure that intellectual property is respected. \r\n\r\nTurnitin is constantly being updated with new entries. Assignments submitted by you and your classmates are scanned and added to the database. The similarity score is the percentage of text from your assignment that exactly matches other sources on the Turnitin database. \r\n\r\nThere are five possible similarity ranges, from 0\u2013100%. The colour of the report icon represents the score. It\u2019s very unlikely that your report icon will be blue, but don\u2019t panic. The score is just an indication of matching text and will be interpreted by your teacher depending on your discipline and the assignment. In some courses you may be able to redraft, using the report to see which areas need adjusting. \r\n\r\nOne way to improve your similarity score is to paraphrase. Avoid direct quotes unless they are important, for example when quoting literature, law or religious texts. Citations are critical to the success of your assessment. They validate your work and support your point of view. \r\n\r\nThere are some great resources on the Learning Lab to help you practice paraphrasing and citing.

Learn what citations are and how to include them in different types of assessments.\r\n\r\nWhat is a citation?\r\nA citation is essentially an abbreviation with a special format. Each citation refers to a different source you are using in your work. It provides a couple of details about the source, and it points the audience to the reference list (sometimes called a bibliography) for further information.\r\n\r\nDepending on the referencing style you\u2019re using, citations can take different forms:\r\n\r\n \tParenthetical citations have information that appears between parentheses or brackets.\r\n \tFootnotes have two parts: a small number that appears above the text line, called a footnote number, and a note at the bottom of the page with more information.\r\n \tEndnotes have the same small numbers as footnotes, but the notes appear at the end of the document or section of writing.\r\n\r\nTips for inserting citations in written work\r\nParenthetical citations can appear at the beginning or end of a quote, paraphrase, or summary. You can also have more than one citation in a sentence if you are synthesising the ideas from multiple sources. When citations are placed at the end of a sentence, they generally appear inside the sentence punctuation.\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n\r\n \t\". . .\" (Author 2022:62).\r\n \tAccording to Author (2022), . . .\r\n \tIn contrast, Researcher\u2019s (2023) study suggested . . .\r\n \tWhile Author (2022) proposed . . ., this idea was rejected by Researcher (2023) due to . . .\r\n \tAuthor (2022) and Researcher (2023) agree that . . ., but others take the viewpoint that . . . (Writer 2022; Creator 2023).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote and endnote numbers appear at the end of the ideas you\u2019re referencing, but similar to parenthetical citations, you can integrate information about the source, such as the surnames of the authors, using reporting words. Unlike parenthetical citations, footnote and endnote numbers are placed outside the sentence punctuation.\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n\r\n \tAccording to Author, . . .1\r\n \tWhile Author proposed . . .,1 this idea was rejected by Researcher due to . . .2\r\n\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t forget that in general, footnote numbers need corresponding footnotes at the bottom of each page, and endnote numbers need endnotes at the end of the document or section of writing. For more examples and the complete guidelines for the referencing styles used at RMIT, visit Easy Cite.\r\nCitations in presentations and multimedia work\r\nIt is important to include citations in all of your work, including presentations and multimedia projects.\r\n\r\nWhen you are giving an oral presentation or creating a multimedia piece that references the ideas of others, make sure to incorporate the same information you would include in a written citation. Depending on the referencing style you\u2019re following, this might mean mentioning the surnames of authors and dates of publications when speaking.

And if you use AI tools when it isn\u2019t permitted, that would be a breach of academic integrity.\r\n\r\nAnother important point is that many generative-text AI tools, such as the current version of ChatGPT, were not designed to provide sources. Because they are simply models of how language works, they have no concept of 'information' or where it might have come from. This means that when asked for the source of information, they will make up books and journal articles that sound real, but don't actually exist.\r\n\r\nFinally, you should be aware that the companies who have developed AI tools will often save any information that you enter to continue training their tools. You should not upload any documents that you don't own, such as course materials or readings, to external AI tools.

Let's explore how it can be used to evaluate information from social media.\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial media is one way that people learn what\u2019s happening in the world. But anyone can share just about anything online. Before you repost or retweet, how can you be sure that what you\u2019re reading isn\u2019t fake news?\r\n\r\nWhen we see or hear information that aligns with a belief we already hold, we generally don\u2019t question it. \r\nTo illustrate, if you think a certain political party is plagued by corruption, you\u2019re likely to believe a post saying one of their members was involved in a scandal.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur tendency to trust information that supports what we already believe, and to ignore other facts and evidence, is called confirmation bias. Combine confirmation bias with a provocative social media post, and misinformation can spread rapidly. It\u2019s important to consider whether what you\u2019re reading and seeing is factual, especially if you\u2019re going to share it with your online community.\r\nThe SIFT method\r\nThe SIFT method is a set of four simple steps to help you determine whether something you are reading online, or anywhere, is trustworthy.\r\n\r\nSIFT stands for\r\n\r\n \tStop\r\n \tInvestigate the source\r\n \tFind better coverage\r\n \tTrace claims, quotes and media back to their original context.\r\n\r\nThese steps are all about understanding the source and context of the information, so that you can decide before you even read it whether it is valid and reliable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStop\r\nThis first step reminds you to pause and consider whether you know and trust the source of the information you\u2019re reading. If you have any doubts, continue with the next steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInvestigate the source\r\n\r\nBefore you dig into an idea you find online, it\u2019s helpful to know where it\u2019s coming from. If you\u2019re not familiar with a website, look it up on Wikipedia for an overview. Knowing the expertise, perspective and agenda of the source can help you to better analyse and interpret the information provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind better coverage\r\nTo determine whether a claim is true, find more information about the topic from trusted sources. You can try to find the best, most authoritative source on a topic, or you can read multiple sources to see how different publications treat a claim you are investigating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrace claims, quotes and media back to their original context\r\nSome people or organisations might not provide the whole picture of a topic. Quotes can be taken out of context, claims distorted, and media altered to support a particular perspective. Tracing these back to the original source allows you to see the original context and decide if the ideas have been presented accurately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApply your understanding\r\nRead the content shared below and consider whether the information is factual and trustworthy.

You can contact them if you have queries about learning materials, timetables, assessment dates, etc.\r\n\r\nCourse coordinators also:\r\n\r\n \tworking with the program manager and the department head to prepare course objectives\r\n \tleading the course team, recruitment, training and management of the tutors for the particular course\r\n \torganising guest lectures or industry expert seminars.\r\n\r\nLecturer\/VE teacher\r\nLecturers facilitate the learning process, and assess and mentor students according to the course curriculum. They are content experts in a specific discipline. Often your course coordinator and\/or program coordinator will also be one of the lecturers delivering the course. \r\n\r\nVE educators are usually referred to as teachers. They deliver learning materials in a classroom\/lecture theatre (face-to-face) or online (via Teams or Collaborate Ultra). When you have difficulties understanding course materials, you can always contact your teacher and ask for further explanation.\r\n\r\nThe main responsibilities of lecturera and VE teachers include:\r\n\r\n \tdelivery of quality education and training to the students\r\n \tengaging students in the learning process\r\n \ttraining for technical skills associated with the course, such as laboratory skills, computer skills, etc.\r\n \tassessment preparation and marking.\r\n\r\nGuest lecturers and industry professionals\r\nMost university level courses offer lectures or seminars from guest lecturers or industry professionals, experts in their fields, as work-integrated learning. They share insights and experiences from their career as well as current knowledge in the industry or profession. These seminars provide an opportunity to ask questions about the industry or profession you will enter after your studies, as well as a networking platform.\r\n\r\nTutors\r\nTutors usually deliver tutorial sessions, workshops and lectorials with or without a lecturer. They help you understand tutorial questions, complex concepts from the course material and provide feedback on your learning. Most importantly, they are approachable during the class\/session. Most tutors in undergraduate and postgraduate courses are current PhD students.\r\nLibrarians\r\nLibrarians are information professionals who supports learning, teaching and research. THey are experts in information literacy, which is the ability to identify and evaluate reliable sources of information. They're available to support students via online and on-campus consultations, as well as delivering workshops classes. \r\n\r\nLibrarians can guide you to the best resources for your assignments. They can also assist you in developing research skills such as evaluating the reliabity of information sources, which is extremely valuable for your assignments.\r\nAcademic skills advisors\r\nAcademic Skills Advisors provide valuable advice and support across a range of subject areas and academic skills. This includes writing, assignment planning and structure, English language, presentation skills and more. Some are specialists in subject areas including science and maths. They are available for online on-campus consultations with studrnts, as well as delivering in-class workshops.\r\nLaboratory demonstrators \/ Technicians\r\nLaboratory demonstrators play a vital role in the delivery of practical-based classes. They teach and assist you with laboratory skills. They are available to answer student questions during the class, provide clear explanations that combining theory and the practical aspect and provide feedback on your laboratory skills and laboratory-based written work. In VE, laboratory demonstrators are called technicians.\r\nPlacement supervisors\r\nA placement supervisor is a professional who works in a specific field and is assigned by the organisation to guide, teach, and support students during their placement. They are usually willing to share knowledge, provide close guidance to develop professional practice skills and create a supportive environment to work.\r\nHDR supervisors\r\nHigher Degree by Research (HDR) students have completed a undergraduate degree and are continuing their studies through completing a postgraduate study. This may include a Masters' by research or PhD (Doctor of Philosophy).\r\n\r\nThe HDR supervisory team guide, mentor, and support students throughout the HDR candidature.

If the examples or ideas we use come from other people, it is important that we give them appropriate credit for their work. This is called referencing.\r\n\r\nUsing other people's ideas\r\nIn academics and professional settings, referencing means acknowledging others' work and ideas. \r\n\r\nFor academic tasks, you often need to research topics, and collect data, images, and other information to support your point. Whenever you use someone else's ideas, you must inform the reader where the ideas came from.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferencing has two parts: citations, and the reference list.\r\n\r\n \tIn the body of your work, any time you want to use a direct quote from someone else, talk about their ideas more generally, or incorporate a piece of their creative work into your own, you\u2019ll include a citation. Citations offer your audience key pieces of information about the source of an idea, such as the author\u2019s surname and the year of publication.\r\n \tAt the end of your work, you\u2019ll include a reference list or bibliography. These provide the complete publication information for the sources you\u2019ve cited. Every citation will refer to an entry in the reference list or bibliography.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach professional discipline or area of study uses a specific set of referencing rules, called style guides. These style guides explain how to format citations and create a reference list. APA, Chicago, and RMIT Harvard are the names of some popular referencing styles. You can find the rules for these styles by visiting Easy Cite.\r\nWhy is referencing important?\r\nReferencing strengthens your arguments\r\nUsing references demonstrates that you have explored existing research on your topic. It shows you are forming your own arguments based on the work of others in the field. This not only displays professionalism but also helps build trust with your audience.\r\nReferencing enables others to understand how you came to your conclusions\r\nReferences help others find the information you used to build your arguments. For example, if you use information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, someone can find this information by checking your reference list and visiting the source. This allows others to check your statements and see how you reached your conclusions.\r\nReferencing shows you are acting with academic integrity\r\nWhen you state where you found your information, you are showing respect for the work of others. This is a key aspect of academic integrity. It shows your audience what knowledge or work already existed, and what ideas are your own. All publications are the intellectual property of the authors, so taking someone\u2019s ideas without acknowledgement and representing them as your own is a form of theft and fraud, known as plagiarism.","excerpt":"We often use the ideas and work of others to support our own thinkingand make a convincing argument.

Using someone\u2019s words in their original form is called quoting, or including a direct quote.\r\n\r\nWhen to quote\r\nQuoting is the way to include the exact words of others in our own work. You might want to use a quote when the specific words that an author or speaker has used are important, such as when someone offers a new definition for a term or presents a new theory.\r\n\r\nIt is important to only use direct quotes when the exact words of someone else add particular value. If you use too many quotes, you are simply reporting information that you have found, instead of offering your own analysis and evaluation of the ideas. Paraphrasing and summarising, on the other hand, show that you have really understood the ideas or issues you are investigating.\r\nHow to insert a direct quote\r\nFollow these steps to use direct quotes in your written assignments.\r\n\r\n \tCopy the exact words from the original source. (If your quote is 40 words or longer, see the section below on using a block quote).\r\n \tUse quotation marks \" \" at the beginning and end of the copied text.\r\n \tCite the quote following the citation format for your referencing style. This often means including information such as the author\u2019s surname, year of publication, and the page number where the quote appears.\r\n\r\nWritten example\r\nWhile no single description exists for the concept of procrastination, it has been defined as \"delaying tasks to the point where personal discomfort is felt\" (Chin &amp; Grey, 2023).\r\nIf you are reading a direct quote as part of an oral or multimedia presentation, you'll want to include the same citation information. You might say something like the example below.\r\nSpoken example\r\nWhile no single description exists for the concept of procrastination, Solomon and Rothblum defined the concept in their 1984 study, page 503, as \"the act of needlessly delaying tasks to the point of experiencing subjective discomfort\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note: The examples on this page use the APA referencing style.

It\u2019s easy to become repetitive, using \u2018this author states\u2019 and \u2018that author states\u2019 over and over. Keep reading to learn about how to use a variety of reporting verbs in your writing.\r\n\r\nReporting words\r\nReporting words are verbs that help us describe an author\u2019s position on a topic. The reporting word you choose can help your audience understand the viewpoint of the original author, or it might express your own opinion about that author\u2019s work. There are many of these reporting words in English, and they have different meanings. Some are more forceful, while others express a more modest position on a topic.\r\nExamples\r\n\"Author (2023) questions the idea that income from Australian mining exports will likely increase in the next two years.\"\r\n\"Author (2023) dismisses the idea that income from Australian mining exports will likely increase in the next two years.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first example, the word 'questions' shows the audience that Author (2023) doesn\u2019t necessarily believe mining export income will increase. In contrast, the use of the word 'dismisses' in the second example shows a much stronger position. Here, Author is no longer just questioning the idea, but has completely rejected it.\r\n\r\nChoosing the right reporting word is tricky. Words have small differences in meaning, as well as in the positive, negative, or neutral feelings connected to them, also known as connotation.

Weekly and semester timetables are an excellent way to plan a study program. Students can use them to manage their most important study, work and social commitments and to set themselves study goals. Blocks of time can then be set aside for study, reading, researching and writing. The most urgent tasks can be addressed, whilst work continues on preparing for lectures, tutorials and assignments. If time has been allocated for specific purposes, it is easier to avoid unexpected demands like phone calls, visitors and invitations. Assignments can be completed and submitted on time and to a satisfactory standard.\r\nSummary\r\nEffective time management allows students to utilise their time in order to successfully complete their study requirements (Author 2003).\r\nPractice summarising\r\nRead the fictional text below, and then choose the best summary from the three options given.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note: The examples on this page use the RMIT Harvard referencing style.

Like any community, everyone contributes to keep things running. We might only view these educational organisation as places to learn. However, they do so much more to contribute to society, so having an understanding of how they operate will help you get the most out your time there.\r\nSpaces and resources\r\nA university is much more than a collection of classrooms. Universities provide students with a variety of study, collaboration, social, recreational and creative spaces.\r\n\r\nThe campus\r\nUniversity campuses are vibrant places and can be crowded with people walking to various buildings and social spaces. The campus community is generally made up of students, teachers, professional staff, and visitors.\r\n\r\nSome of your learning may take place on campus where spaces are set up for a variety of different types of learning including:\r\n\r\n \tlectures\r\n \tlabs\r\n \tclassrooms for tutorials\r\n \tmedia studios\r\n \tcreative spaces\r\n \tstudy spaces\r\n \tthe library\r\n \tcommon areas\r\n \tcafes\r\n\r\nWifi allows you to connect your PC, laptop, mobile phone or tablet device without using a cable. Wifi access points are across the campus, making everywhere a study space.\r\n\r\nUniversity campuses provide recreational and social spaces for students such as sports facilities, like gyms, basketball courts and running tracks. Social events are held on campus for students to hang out with classmates and get to know their peers.\r\n\r\nUniversity libraries as community and cultural spaces\r\nUniversity libraries are centrally located on campus where the university community can come together to meet, collaborate and build a sense of place. Libraries are often positioned near other services where you may seek information and advice, like the enrolment centre and student union.\r\n\r\nLibraries help build community in several ways. They offer study support through drop-ins or consultations, workshops and training, as well as cultural events like exhibitions and seminars. At the same time, libraries also provide a quiet environment for students to study on their own.\r\n\r\nSome Libraries manage makerspaces, where students gather to work on projects while sharing ideas, equipment, and knowledge. A makerspace is often equiped with 3D printers and laser cutters.\r\nStudy spaces\r\nThe space in which you work plays an important role in productivity as well as improving focus and efficiency.\r\n\r\nWhen setting up a study space, it's a good idea to have all the materials you need within reach. That could be physical items like a notebook, pens, highlighters and course material like course notes, textbooks, calculator.\r\n\r\nWhen setting up a digital study space consider bookmarking study resources frequently used to improve organisation. It's also set up some folders for online documents for your courses.\r\n\r\nWhen working in a group space on campus, hoose a space that will enable you and your group members to talk freely, exchange ideas and plan your work. Booking a group room on campus is one option and another is to arrange an online meeting with your group.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"This section will introduce you to the people and places that make up a tertiary institution and help unpack some of the concepts so they feel a little more familiar. Tertiary institutions are large places with lots of different spaces and staff members who support these spaces and students. Like any community, everyone contributes to keep things running. We might only view these educational organisation as places to learn. However, they do so much more to contribute to society, so having an understanding of how they operate will help you get the most out your time there.

Your institution will run an orientation program to help you get started, including events, activities and resources.\r\nThe first few months of university study will be a time of significant change. You're expected to navigate a new campus, meet new people and develop a new way of learning. While you may work out many of these changes yourself, there's a wide range of support to help you transition to this new environment.\r\n\r\nOften your university orientation program begins before the start of classes, so you have the time to explore the campus, meet new people, and develop new habits. Your university email will provide important communication to help you get the most out of the orientation program. \r\n\r\nThere'll be events and activities run by clubs and societies and offers from partner organisations. Many of these will be promoted on campus, so travelling in to campus if you can during this time may help you get the most out of orientation.\r\n\r\nThe people who will help you through your studies will be your teachers, professional and academic support services, and your fellow students. This period is perfect to get to know them better. Once classes start, so does the coursework.\r\n\r\nIf you enrol late or miss the orientation program, you might have to work a little harder to adapt to university life. Keep an eye out for support information that will be available all year round.\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Transitioning to higher education, whether from high school or work, is a significant step.

We live in many systems:\r\n\r\n \tsolar system\r\n \tjustice systems\r\n \tIT systems\r\n \teconomic systems\r\n\r\nSystems thinking means considering the effects on all parts of a system rather than just one. We live on the planet earth, which is a closed system. Waste we generate stays on earth. Damaging the environment in one area can have effects on other areas.\r\nCircular economy\r\nThe circular economy uses systems thinking to create products that are meant to be recycled or reused. You can see the difference between a traditional linear economy and a circular economy in engineering, in the image below. Circular economies do not end in waste; products are reused or recycled, or even better designed with the next purpose in mind.\r\n\r\nRepair, reuse, recycle\r\nA circular economy requires that products are made in a way that does not create waste. Making products that have little or no waste is much better than relying on recycling. Products that are built to be reusable or easily repaired are the best.\r\n\r\nThere are many examples from the past when people owned their clothes, furniture, and other items for life or even longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnological waste\r\nTechnology produces a lot of waste, some of it is toxic. The materials used to make phones, laptops, games consoles and other technology are hard or impossible to recycle, and therefore create waste when they are created and waste at the end of their life.\r\n\r\nThere is a push for tech companies to make products that can be easily repaired rather than thrown away. Allowing people to fix their phones and replace broken parts will save a lot of money and stop a lot of waste.\r\nReusable bottles and containers\r\nIn many places, milk used to be sold in reusable glass bottles. The empty bottles were left out after use and taken back to be cleaned and refilled with fresh milk. There are some grocery stores that sell their food without any packaging today, where customers bring their own containers to fill with the products they want to buy.\r\nJars as drinking glasses\r\n\r\nFor many years, Vegemite and other products were sold in jars that were designed to be drinking glasses when empty. Jars were even printed with cartoon characters and pictures. When glass recycling became more available, the jars were not made anymore. But it is much better to reuse glass. Glass recycling uses a lot of energy \u2013 to melt the glass and reshape it \u2013 and putting jars on a truck makes air pollution. Putting Vegemite and Nutella in jars that were reused was a circular economy.\r\nRepair\r\nPeople did not always buy new things like we do today. In the past, people repaired things when they broke or reused them in a new way. There are many cities with 'repair cafes' where you can take broken items to be fixed, saving you money, and saving the environment.\r\n\r\nWhile there are many ideas from the past that we could bring back, there are also ways to create modern items that make less waste.","excerpt":"Systems thinking is a way of thinking about our products, businesses and services not just in terms of the final product or service, but also the ways that product or service impacts people and planet.

(UN, n.d.)\r\n\r\nInitially, there were eight United Nations sustainable development goals, called the Millenium Development Goals, which started in 2000 and finished in 2015. The Millenium Development Goals were redeveloped into the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs have a timelilne for completion by 2030.\r\n\r\nThere are currently 17 goals, 169 targets and 232 indicators. Providing the details of targets and indicators helps people measure the progress of each goal. Creating goals that are Strategic, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timely (SMART goals) is a great way to make sure any goal will be completed and measured.\r\n\r\nRMIT University, like other institutions, has chosen to use the UN SDGs to guide its sustainability plans.\r\n\r\nThe 17 UN SDGs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals timeline\r\nExplore the information in the accordions folders to see a timeline of key moments in the UN's history, and the origins and future of the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuiz\r\nTake the quiz to test your knowledge of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\r\n\r\n\r\nImage by Derek Sutton via Unsplash, licensed under\u00a0CC0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nSustainable Development Goals Fund.

These projects are only a few of many projects happening across the world. The power of an SDG is that it is global and targeted.\r\nThe Litter Trackers\r\nRMIT has been working with other organisations to create an education programme about litter in Melbourne. Litter left on the ground is washed into stormwater drains and from there into Port Phillip Bay. Rubbish and litter has a negative effect on the environment, the creatures living in the bay, birds and more. By tracking litter, the program can educate people about the importance of disposing of waste properly.\r\n\r\nFind out more about The Litter Trackers: Reducing Littering by Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAquatic Pollution Prevention Partnership\r\nRMIT is not just working on educating people about litter in Port Phillip Bay, it is also preventing it from reaching the water.\r\n\r\nIn this partnership with Melbourne Water, RMIT is working on solutions to prevent litter and other waste from reaching Port Phillip Bay and other Victorian waterways.\r\n\r\nLearn more about the Aquatic Pollution prevention Partnership\r\n\r\nThese examples show that sustainability projects often address more than one SDG. For example, a project that educates, reduced litter and works to improve water quality, can have impacts on Goal 6 \u2014 Clean water and sanitation and Goal 4 \u2014 Quality education.

There are three main points \u2026\r\nVoice emphasis\r\nIn lectures and tutorials, important ideas, words and phrases are often emphasised. A lecturer or teacher may do this by saying them more slowly, more loudly, or by pausing. Gestures and movement may also be used for emphasis.\r\nLinking expressions\r\nListen for words and phrases that direct you to new and important ideas or show the relationships between the points being raised. Examples include:\r\n\r\n \tAddition words \u2013 also, too, in addition, furthermore, another\r\n \tEmphasis words \u2013 importantly, specifically, especially, obviously\r\n \tSequencing words \u2013 firstly, secondly, next, finally\r\n \tContrast words \u2013 however, but, despite, on the other hand, conversely\r\n \tConcession words \u2013 although, even though, in the light of, given that\r\n \tIllustration words \u2013 for example, to illustrate, that is\r\n \tReason and result words \u2013 consequently, because, therefore, leads to\r\n \tSummary words \u2013 in conclusion, to sum up, in summary\r\n\r\nRepetition and elaboration\r\nImportant points are repeated or illustrated with examples by your lecturer.\r\nAfter class\r\nYour independent study time after class is some of your most valuable time as a study; use it wisely. Revise notes within 24 hours of the class. Don\u2019t just file them away!\r\n\r\nSome different ways to revise notes after class:\r\n\r\n \tDiscuss ideas with a study group\r\n \tDraw a mind map of the key ideas\r\n \tDo some follow up reading about the key ideas\r\n \tThink about how ideas relate to your assignments, exams or future career\r\n","excerpt":"Actively taking notes in class can help you understand the topic better.

It may also detail the implications of the research and make recommendations for changes to policy and practice directions or directions for further research.\r\nReferences: A list of the literature on which the research was based.\r\n\r\nReading strategies for academic articles\r\nThe principles of active reading can be applied to academic articles.\r\nThink about why you are reading the article. \r\nKey texts\r\nIf the article is a key text that you need to understand thoroughly, then you might start by surveying the text- reading the article title, finding out about the author, looking at the heading titles and checking out an visual elements such as graphs and charts. \r\nWhile you read, remember to think critically. Just because you are reading an academic article, does  not mean that you must agree with everything theory or idea expressed in it. Consider whether the information is credible, whether the research has been carried out in an effective way and if the conclusions drawn from the research are logical.\r\nSearching for specific information\r\nThis is where skimming and scanning will come in handy. \r\nBefore you start reading, decide what information you are looking for- list down any key words, terms or numerical data that you would like to search for.\r\nNext, review read quickly through the articles content, stopping when you find a key word or anything that you feel may be relevant. Then, read the text surrounding the key word or information carefully while taking notes.\r\nSearching for general information\r\nWhen searching for general information, many students start by reading the title of the article and the abstract. From this, they are often able to tell if the article will contain information that is useful to them. \r\nIf it doesn't, then they can move on to the next article without having lost time reading something that is not relevant. \r\nIf they believe the article does contain relevant information for their assignment, then they move on to reading the introduction for more information on the purpose of the article, followed by the discussion and\/or conclusion sections. These sections will provide an interpretation of the results and summarise the main points.","excerpt":"Reading academic articles can be tricky and time consuming.

You also need to understand angles in degrees and radians.\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nGiven that \\(\\sin\\theta=0.3,\\) find all values of \\(\\theta\\) in the domain \\(\\left\\{ \\theta:0^{\\circ}\\leq\\theta\\leq360^{\\circ}\\right\\} .\\)\r\nSolution\r\nDraw a picture showing the possible positive values for \\(\\theta\\) as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are at least two solutions shown in red and blue. We have \\(\\theta_{r}\\) (in red) which is given by \\[\\begin{align*} \\theta_{r} &amp; =\\sin^{-1}\\left(0.3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =17.46^{\\circ}.\\text{ (from calculator)} \\end{align*}\\] The other angle \\(\\theta_{b}\\) (in blue) may be found by symmetry: \\[\\begin{align*} \\theta_{b} &amp; =180^{\\circ}-\\theta_{r}\\\\ &amp; =180^{\\circ}-17.46^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =162.54^{\\circ}. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the solutions are \\(\\theta=17.46^{\\circ},\\,162.54^{\\circ}.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nGiven that \\(\\sin\\theta=0.3,\\) find all values of \\(\\theta\\) such that \\(0^{\\circ}\\leq\\theta\\leq500^{\\circ}.\\)\r\nSolution\r\nNote that this is the same problem as in Example 1 except that the domain in which we are looking for solutions has been extended to \\(500^{\\circ}.\\)\r\n\r\nDraw a picture showing the possible positive values for \\(\\theta\\) as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Example 1 we know \\(\\theta=17.46^{\\circ}\\)or \\(162.54^{\\circ}.\\) If we add \\(360^{\\circ}\\) to each of these, they will still satisfy \\(\\sin\\theta=0.3.\\) The question is, are they in the domain of interest?\r\n\r\nAdding \\(360^{\\circ}\\) to the solution \\(\\theta=17.46^{\\circ}\\) found in Example 1 gives \\[\\begin{align*} \\theta &amp; =17.46^{\\circ}+360^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =377.46^{\\circ} \\end{align*}\\] which is less than \\(500^{\\circ}\\) and so a solution to Example 2. Adding \\(360^{\\circ}\\) to the other solution to Example \\(1\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} \\theta &amp; =162.54^{\\circ}+360^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =522.54^{\\circ} \\end{align*}\\] which is bigger than \\(500^{\\circ}\\) and so not a solution to Example 2.\r\n\r\nHence the solutions are \\(\\theta=17.46^{\\circ},\\,162.54^{\\circ}\\) and \\(377.46^{\\circ}.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\nSolve \\(\\cos\\alpha=0.5\\) over the domain \\(\\left\\{ \\alpha:0\\leq\\alpha\\leq2\\pi\\right\\} .\\)\r\nSolution\r\nDraw a picture showing the possible positive values for \\(\\alpha\\) as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferring to the figure, \\[\\begin{align*} \\alpha_{1} &amp; =\\cos^{-1}\\left(0.5\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\ (\\text{from calculator)} \\end{align*}\\] and from symmetry of the unit circle, \\[\\begin{align*} \\alpha_{2} &amp; =2\\pi-\\alpha_{1}\\\\ &amp; =2\\pi-\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5\\pi}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the solution is \\(\\alpha=\\pi\/3\\) and \\(5\\pi\/3.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 4\r\nSolve \\(\\cos\\alpha=0.5\\) over the domain \\(\\left\\{ \\alpha:-2\\pi\\leq\\alpha\\leq2\\pi\\right\\} .\\)\r\nSolution\r\nNote this is the same problem as in Example 3 but the domain has been extended.\r\n\r\nDraw a picture showing the possible positive and negative values for \\(\\alpha\\) as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two positive angles (shown in red) are the same as those in Example 3, namely \\[\\begin{align*} \\alpha_{1} &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\\\ \\alpha_{2} &amp; =\\frac{5\\pi}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] The negative angles (shown in blue) are \\(\\alpha_{3}\\) and \\(\\alpha_{4}.\\) Using the results from Example 3 and symmetry we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\alpha_{3} &amp; =-\\alpha_{1}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\alpha_{4} &amp; =-\\left(2\\pi-\\alpha_{1}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\alpha_{1}-2\\pi\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\pi}{3}-2\\pi\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{5\\pi}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the solution is \\(\\alpha=-\\frac{5\\pi}{3},\\,-\\frac{\\pi}{3},\\,\\frac{\\pi}{3},\\,\\frac{5\\pi}{3}.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 5\r\nSolve \\(\\tan\\left(2x\\right)=-3\\) over the domain \\(\\left\\{ x:-90^{\\circ}\\leq x\\leq180^{\\circ}\\right\\} .\\)\r\nSolution\r\nSince the variable is \\(2x,\\) we have to redefine the domain to \\(\\left\\{ 2x:-180^{\\circ}\\leq2x\\leq360^{\\circ}\\right\\} .\\)\r\n\r\nDraw a picture showing the possible positive and negative values for \\(2x\\) as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two positive angles \\(\\alpha_{1},\\,\\alpha_{2}\\) (shown in red) and two negative angles \\(\\alpha_{3,}\\,\\alpha_{4}\\) (shown in blue) that may lie within \\(-180^{\\circ}\\leq2x\\leq360^{\\circ}.\\)\r\n\r\nWe have \\[\\begin{align*} \\tan\\left(2x\\right) &amp; =-3\\\\ 2x &amp; =\\tan^{-1}\\left(-3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-71.57^{\\circ}\\ \\text{(from calculator).} \\end{align*}\\] Referring to the figure, we see that \\[\\begin{align*} \\alpha_{3} &amp; =-71.57^{\\circ} \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\alpha_{4} &amp; =\\alpha_{3}-180^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =-71.57^{\\circ}-180^{\\circ}\\\\ &amp; =-251.57^{\\circ}. \\end{align*}\\] Note that this is outside of the domain for \\(2x\\) and so is rejected.

It is not sustainable for people to live in poverty to keep the costs of products low.\r\n\r\nBusinesses need to pay people a 'living wage'.

There are many areas of manufacture in the fashion and textile industry where changes can be made to make this industry more sustainable.\r\n\r\nTextile recycling \u2013 the textiles (fabric and other materials used to make clothing) can be broken down and the fibres (threads that make up the fabric) can be recycled into new clothes.\r\n\r\nRepair \u2013 creating garments that are easy to repair ensures that they can last longer.\r\n\r\nWages \u2013 garment workers (people who make clothes) are paid a living wage.\r\n\r\nReuse \u2013 high quality, well made clothes can be resold many times. Cheap, badly made clothes cannot.\r\nWhat is fast fashion?\r\nFast fashion is growing around the world. Fast fashion are clothes made very cheaply and quickly that are only worn a few times before being thrown away.\r\n\r\nPeople today own far more clothes than they used to in the past, and some of these clothes are cheap and not made to last. The actual cost of the clothes is much higher than the price people are paying to buy them if we think about the cost of waste produced.\r\n\r\nSome experts have suggested that by making clothes more expensive to cover the cost of dealing with clothing waste, we might stop people from buying so many cheap clothes.\r\n\r\nThe rise of Internet shopping, propelled further by the recent pandemic, has made it very easy to buy new clothes. Many of these clothes are very cheap. No one needs to buy new clothes every week or every month. Making clothes more expensive to cover the cost of waste is one way to change fast fashion.\r\n\r\nThere are companies recycling textiles that break down the clothes and create new threads and materials. There are many drop-off points in Australia that will accept old clothes for recycling. Buying recycled clothing can help to make the fashion industry more sustainable. If you are choosing new clothes, look for recycled fabrics and support companies that recycle, or are 'fair trade' and pay their workers a fair price for their labour.\r\n","excerpt":"The clothing industry is global, extremely large and prolific because we all need clothes to wear.

From companies putting on 'green' festivals to guides for creating a more sustainable event.\r\n\r\nThere are some easy ways to make your event greener.\r\nWater\r\nEncourage people to bring their own water bottle to the event. Provide people with places they can refill water bottles. Consider selling or giving away reusable water bottles so everyone can use one.\r\n\r\nDid you know you can hire composting or chemical toilets? Using water to flush toilets uses anwhere between 6 to 15 litres of water per flush.\r\nWaste\r\nSorting waste on the site and making sure it goes to the right place is the first step. Where is the right place? Where the waste is recycled or reused rather than going to landfill.\r\n\r\nHaving clear signs will make sure the waste goes to the right bin, saving recycling from being contaminated with rubbish.\r\nFood waste\r\nSell tickets or ask people to register to come. Then you know how many people will be there and you can order enough food for everyone and not waste extra food. Any leftover food and green waste can be collected and turned to compost or soil.\r\nEnergy\r\nThink about where will your power will come from. Can you use solar panels and batteries instead of electricity from fossil fuels?\r\nTransportation\r\nConsider how people will get to the festival. Will public transport be available? Make it easy for people to leave their cars at home by:\r\n\r\n \tchoosing\u00a0a site close to public transportation\r\n \tproviding bike parking\r\n \tproviding a bus from the train station\r\n \treducing\u00a0the cost of car parking for people who ride share\r\n \tcreating or using walking trails\r\n","excerpt":"There are many kinds of festivals and events: music, art, balloons, food and wine, and lots more.

By adding recycled tyres and other waste materials to concrete, they have made stronger and longer lasting concrete. This means the concrete is not only a better quality product, they're also removing waste and recycling a dangerous substance, removing it from landfill. Finding methods like this to recycle, reuse, upcycle and reduce waste in construction is extremely important for sustainable construction.\r\n","excerpt":"Construction, factories, railway lines, roads and many other things we rely on, are a big part of the modern world.

It also considers where the materials are made. Some countries will have different rules that can impact how much waste a company generates making materials.\r\n\r\nThe Higg Index developers applied five principles to understand how sustainable different fabrics are:\r\n\r\n \tclimate impact (how much heat this will add to the world's climate)\r\n \twater pollution (how much and what kind of pollution will go into waterways while making this fabric?)\r\n \twater use (some fabrics use a lot more water than others in production)\r\n \tuse of fossil fuels (this includes products made of fossil fuels and ones that use fossil fuels for transport or when they are made)\r\n \tchemistry (what is the fabric made of? How will those chemicals breakdown and react after they are not wanted any more?)\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the impact of different fabrics gives designers and companies a way to make more sustainable clothing. The Higg index has expanded since it was first developed. Now, companies can look at their impact from \"cradle-to-grave\" or from the raw materials they use to the waste after the product has finished. This lifecycle view looks at transportation, office spaces, suppliers, materials and much more to help companies find ways to be more sustainable.\r\n\r\nNote: the Higg Index has been criticised for scoring fabric from fossil fuels too highly (nylon and other plastic based fabrics) and rating them more highly than natural fibres (leather, silk and others). In response to this criticism, the Index is not being used as a promotional or marketing tool by fashion brands, anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond fashion\r\nThe Higg Index suite of tools measures the environmental impact of different materials in other industries too. Home textiles, shoes, fashion and other uses of fabric and materials can have the Higg Index applied to their products. \"Materials\" in this context means the parts that a product is made of. A shoe might be made from leather, plastic and rubber \u2014 these are the shoe's materials.\r\n\r\nDesigners and developers can look at the Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) of materials to find options that are lower in carbon emissions.\r\n\r\nAnyone can create an account and use the Higg index tools to green their business and make it more sustainable.

For any two differentiable functions \\(v\\left(x\\right)\\) and \\(u\\left(x\\right)\\) we have, by the product rule, \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(v\\left(x\\right)u\\left(x\\right)\\right) &amp; =v\\left(x\\right)\\frac{du\\left(x\\right)}{dx}+u\\left(x\\right)\\frac{dv\\left(x\\right)}{dx}. \\end{align*}\\] Integrating both sides with respect to \\(x\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(v\\left(x\\right)u\\left(x\\right)\\right)dx &amp; =\\int\\left(v\\left(x\\right)\\frac{du\\left(x\\right)}{dx}+u\\left(x\\right)\\frac{dv\\left(x\\right)}{dx}\\right)dx,\\;\\textrm{that is,}\\\\ v\\left(x\\right)u\\left(x\\right) &amp; =\\int v\\left(x\\right)\\frac{du\\left(x\\right)}{dx}dx+\\int u\\left(x\\right)\\frac{dv\\left(x\\right)}{dx}dx. \\end{align*}\\] This can be rearranged to give the formula for integration by parts: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int v\\left(x\\right)\\frac{du\\left(x\\right)}{dx}dx &amp; =v\\left(x\\right)u\\left(x\\right)-\\int u\\left(x\\right)\\frac{dv\\left(x\\right)}{dx}dx. \\end{align*}\\] Which is often abbreviated to \\[\\begin{align*} \\int vu'dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe hope is that by choosing the functions \\(v\\) and \\(u'\\) carefully, the integral on the right hand side is easier than the original integral. Successful use of integration by parts requires a correct choice for \\(v\\) and \\(u'\\). If the integral on the right is harder, then try swapping \\(v\\) and \\(u'\\).\r\n\r\nTo assist you in choosing \\(v\\) and \\(u'\\) choose \\(v\\) to be the function that comes first in the sequence of functions:\r\n\r\n \tlogarithmic function\r\n \tinverse trig function\r\n \talgebraic function\r\n \ttrigonometric function\r\n \texponential function\r\n\r\n\\(u'\\) is then the other function in the integrand. 1 The integrand is the function that is being integrated. For example the integrand in \\[ \\int x\\sin\\left(x\\right)dx \\] is \\(x\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\). In this case it is the product of an algebraic function \\(x\\) and a trigonometric function \\(\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) so we would set \\(v=x\\), (because algebraic functions are higher on the list than trigonometric functions), and \\(u'=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nExample 1: Find \\(\\int x\\cos\\left(x\\right)dx\\)\r\nHere we have an algebraic function \\(x\\) and a trigonometric function \\(\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\). Since algebraic functions are higher on the list than trigonometric functions, we let \\(v=x\\) and so \\(u'=du\/dx=\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\). Then \\(v'=dv\/dx=1\\) and \\(u=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\). Using the formula we have: 2 We use \\[\\begin{align*} \\int vu'dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx. \\end{align*}\\] and the fact that \\(\\sin\\left(x\\right)=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\times1\\).  \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x\\cos\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx\\\\ &amp; =x\\sin\\left(x\\right)-\\int\\left(\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\right)\\cdot1dx\\\\ &amp; =x\\sin\\left(x\\right)+\\cos\\left(x\\right)+c,\\;c\\textrm{ a constant.} \\end{align*}\\] Note that if we chose the functions as \\(v=\\cos\\left(x\\right)\\) and \\(u'=x\\), then \\(v'=-\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) and \\(u=\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}.\\) Substituting in the formula will give: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x\\cos\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\\sin\\left(x\\right)-\\int-\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\\sin\\left(x\\right)dx. \\end{align*}\\] The integral on the right is harder than the one we began with and we make no progress. If this happens to you, change the selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2: Find \\(\\int x^{3}\\ln\\left(x\\right)dx\\)\r\nHere we have an algebraic function \\(x^{3}\\) and a logarithmic function \\(\\ln\\left(x\\right)\\). Since logarithmic functions are higher on the list than algebraic functions, we let \\(v=\\ln\\left(x\\right)\\) and so \\(u'=du\/dx=x^{3}\\). Then \\(v'=dv\/dx=1\/x\\) and \\(u=\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}\\). Using the formula we have 3 We use \\[\\begin{align*} \\int vu'dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x^{3}\\ln\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx\\\\ &amp; =\\ln\\left(x\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}\\right)-\\int\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}\\ln\\left(x\\right)-\\frac{1}{4}\\int x^{3}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}\\ln\\left(x\\right)-\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{4}x^{4}+c\\;c\\textrm{ a constant}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{x^{4}\\ln\\left(x\\right)}{4}-\\frac{x^{4}}{16}+c. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3: Find \\(\\int\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)dx\\)\r\nWe apparently have only one function \\(\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\). The trick here is to note that the integrand 4 The integrand is the function that is integrated. In this case it is \\(\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\) which is the same as \\(\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\times1\\). can always be multiplied by \\(1\\) without change. So instead of seeing \\(\\int\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)dx.\\) We see \\(\\int\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\times1dx.\\) We can view \\(1\\) as the constant value function.5 The constant value function \\(1\\) is just a function that gives the value \\(1\\) regardless of its argument. That is \\(1\\left(x\\right)=1\\) for all \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}.\\) The constant value function is algebraic, \\(\\left(1=x^{0}\\right)\\) and below an inverse trigonometric function like \\(\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\) on the list above. So we set \\(v=\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)\\) and \\(du\/dx=1,\\) then \\(dv\/dx=1\/\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\\) and \\(u=x.\\) Substituting in the formula we get:6 We use \\[\\begin{align*} \\int vu'dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx\\\\ &amp; =x\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)-\\int\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}dx. &amp; (1) \\end{align*}\\] The integral on the right hand side can be evaluated with the substitution \\(w=1-x^{2}\\) then \\(dw\/dx=-2x\\) and \\(x=-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dw}{dx}\\), using the substitution rule7 The substitution rule states \\[ \\int f\\left(g\\left(x\\right)\\right)\\frac{dg}{dx}dx=\\int f\\left(w\\right)dw \\] where \\(w=g\\left(x\\right)\\). we get \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}dx &amp; =\\int-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dw}{dx}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{w}}dx\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{2}\\int w^{-1\/2}dw\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(2\\right)w^{1\/2}+c,\\;c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\\\ &amp; =-\\left(1-x^{2}\\right)^{1\/2}+c\\\\ &amp; =-\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+c. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting this result in equation (1) we get the final result \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx\\\\ &amp; =x\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)-\\int\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}dx.\\\\ &amp; =x\\sin^{-1}\\left(x\\right)+\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+c. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRepeated use of integration by parts\r\nSome integrals require the use of the integration by parts technique more than once. For example, consider \\(\\int x^{2}e^{x}dx\\). We have an algebraic function \\(x^{2}\\) multiplying an exponential function \\(e^{x}.\\) According to our guide we set \\(v\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}\\) and \\(u'\\left(x\\right)=e^{x}.\\) Then \\(dv\/dx=2x\\) and \\(u\\left(x\\right)=e^{x}.\\) Substituting in the integration by parts formula we get: 8 We use \\[\\begin{align*} \\int vu'dx &amp; =vu-\\int uv'dx. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x^{2}e^{x}dx &amp; =x^{2}e^{x}-\\int e^{x}\\left(2x\\right)dx. &amp; (2) \\end{align*}\\] The integral on the right hand side requires another integration by parts. We set \\(v\\left(x\\right)=2x\\) and \\(u'\\left(x\\right)=e^{x}.\\) Then \\(dv\/dx=2\\) and \\(u\\left(x\\right)=e^{x}.\\) Substituting in the integration by parts formula gives \\[\\begin{align*} \\int e^{x}\\left(2x\\right)dx &amp; =2xe^{x}-\\int2e^{x}dx\\\\ &amp; =2xe^{x}-2e^{x}+c,\\;c\\in\\mathbb{R}. &amp; (3) \\end{align*}\\] Now substitute this result in equation (2) to get the result \\[\\begin{align*} \\int x^{2}e^{x}dx &amp; =x^{2}e^{x}-\\int e^{x}\\left(2x\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}e^{x}-\\left(2xe^{x}-2e^{x}+c\\right)\\;\\textrm{using ($3$ )}\\\\ &amp; =x^{2}e^{x}-2xe^{x}+2e^{x}-c\\\\ &amp; =e^{x}\\left(x^{2}-2x+2\\right)-c. \\end{align*}\\] Note that it doesn\u2019t matter if we put \\(c\\) or \\(-c\\) as \\(c\\) is just any constant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lll} \\textrm{1.

Integrating using partial fractions helps you to solve this problem. Read this worksheet for several worked examples.\r\nSome times a complex function may be integrated by breaking it up into partial fractions. The idea is that each partial fraction is an easier integral than the original. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int &amp; \\frac{1}{x^{2}+5x+6}dx=\\int\\frac{1}{x+2}dx-\\int\\frac{1}{x+3}dx. \\end{align*}\\] The integrals on the right are much simpler than that on the left. This module explains how this can be done.\r\n\r\nAdding fractions\r\nWhen adding fractions we rewrite the fractions with a common denominator and then add the numerators.1 The numerator is the top line of the fraction and the denominator is the bottom line.

Since \\(x^{2}+2x-3=\\left(x+3\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)\\), we are dealing with the case where the denominator has two distinct linear factors. Therefore we factorize as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3} &amp; =\\frac{x-5}{\\left(x+3\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{A}{x+3}+\\frac{B}{x-1}. \\end{align*}\\] Now we have to determine the constants \\(A\\) and \\(B.\\) First add the partial fractions. We do this by finding a common denominator, in this case \\(\\left(x+3\\right)\\left(x-1\\right):\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{A}{x+3}+\\frac{B}{x-1} &amp; =\\frac{A}{\\left(x+3\\right)}\\times\\frac{\\left(x-1\\right)}{\\left(x-1\\right)}+\\frac{B}{\\left(x-1\\right)}\\times\\frac{\\left(x+3\\right)}{\\left(x+3\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{A\\left(x-1\\right)+B\\left(x+3\\right)}{\\left(x+3\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{Ax-A+Bx+3B}{\\left(x+3\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{Ax+Bx-A+3B}{x^{2}+2x-3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left(A+B\\right)x-A+3B}{x^{2}+2x-3} \\end{align*}\\] That is, \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3} &amp; =\\frac{\\overbrace{\\left(A+B\\right)}^{x-\\textrm{coefficient}}x\\overbrace{-A+3B}^{\\textrm{constant term}}}{x^{2}+2x-3}. \\end{align*}\\] The constants \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) can be found by equating the coefficients of terms on the left and right sides of the equation. On the left, the coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(1\\) and on the right the coefficient is \\(A+B\\) . Similarly the constant term on the left side is \\(-5\\) and on the right it is \\(-A+3B\\). This gives us the following simultaneous equations: \\[\\begin{align*} A+B &amp; =1 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ -A+3B &amp; =-5 &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] These equations are easily solved by elimination. Adding the equations we get \\[\\begin{align*} 4B &amp; =-4\\\\ B &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting for \\(B\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} A-1 &amp; =1\\\\ A &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] Finally we have: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3} &amp; =\\frac{A}{x+3}+\\frac{B}{x-1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2}{x+3}+\\frac{-1}{x-1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2}{x+3}-\\frac{1}{x-1}. \\end{align*}\\] We can now evaluate the integral \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3}dx &amp; =\\int\\left(\\frac{2}{x+3}-\\frac{1}{x-1}\\right)dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int\\frac{2}{x+3}dx-\\int\\frac{1}{x-1}dx\\\\ &amp; =2\\ln\\left|x+3\\right|-\\ln\\left|x-1\\right|+c\\;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ,c\\textrm{ being a constant. } \\end{align*}\\] Using the laws of logarithms, \\(a\\ln\\left(x\\right)=\\ln\\left(x^{a}\\right)\\) and \\(\\ln\\left(a\\right)-\\ln\\left(b\\right)=\\ln\\frac{a}{b}\\) , we can also write the answer as: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3}dx &amp; =2\\ln\\left|x+3\\right|-\\ln\\left|x-1\\right|+c\\;\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ c\\textrm{ being a constant. }\\\\ &amp; =\\ln\\left(x+3\\right)^{2}-\\ln\\left|x-1\\right|+c\\\\ &amp; =\\ln\\frac{\\left(x+3\\right)^{2}}{\\left|x-1\\right|}+c \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2: Find the integral of \\(\\frac{x^{2}-3x+16}{x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5}\\)\r\nWe first factorize the denominator: \\[\\begin{align*} x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5 &amp; =x^{2}\\left(x-5\\right)+x-5\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)\\left(x-5\\right). \\end{align*}\\] In this case we have a quadratic factor and a linear factor. Therefore we factorize as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x^{2}-3x+16}{x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5} &amp; =\\frac{Ax+B}{x^{2}+1}+\\frac{C}{x+5}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left(Ax+B\\right)\\left(x-5\\right)}{\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)\\left(x-5\\right)}+\\frac{C\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)}{\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)\\left(x-5\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{Ax^{2}-5Ax+Bx-5B+Cx^{2}+C}{\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)\\left(x+5\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(A+C\\right)x^{2}+\\left(-5A+B\\right)x-5B+C \\end{align*}\\] Equating coefficients of \\(x^{2}\\), \\(x\\) and the constant gives the three equations: \\[\\begin{align*} A+C &amp; =1 &amp; &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ -5A+B &amp; =-3 &amp; &amp; \\left(2\\right)\\\\ -5B+C &amp; =16. &amp; &amp; \\left(3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] which may be solved simultaneously as follows. Multiply \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) by \\(5\\): \\[\\begin{align*} 5A+5C &amp; =5 &amp; &amp; \\left(4\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and add equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) to \\(\\left(4\\right)\\) to get: \\[\\begin{align*} B+5C &amp; =-3+5\\\\ &amp; =2\\\\ 5B+25C &amp; =10\\;\\textrm{\\;multiplying by $5$ .} &amp; &amp; \\left(5\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Adding equation \\(\\left(5\\right)\\) to \\(\\left(3\\right)\\) gives: \\[\\begin{align*} 26C &amp; =26\\\\ C &amp; =1. &amp; &amp; \\left(6\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Substituting \\(\\left(6\\right)\\) into \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) gives\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} A+1 &amp; =1\\\\ A &amp; =0. &amp; &amp; \\left(7\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Finally substituting \\(A=0\\) in \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} B &amp; =-3. &amp; &amp; \\left(8\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Therefore the partial fraction decomposition is: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x^{2}-3x+16}{x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5} &amp; =\\frac{Ax+B}{x^{2}+1}+\\frac{C}{x-5}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{-3}{x^{2}+1}+\\frac{1}{x-5}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nWe can now do the integral: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\left(\\frac{x^{2}-3x+16}{x^{3}-5x^{2}+x-5}\\right)dx &amp; =\\int\\left(\\frac{-3}{x^{2}+1}+\\frac{1}{x-5}\\right)dx\\;\\;\\textrm{using partial fractions}\\\\ &amp; =\\int\\frac{1}{x-5}dx-3\\int\\frac{1}{x^{2}+1}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\ln\\left|x-5\\right|-3\\tan^{-1}\\left(x\\right)+c,\\ \\ \\;c\\textrm{ being a constant.} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant note\r\nThe process of finding partial fractions can only be performed on fractions where the degree of the denominator of the algebraic fraction is greater than that of the numerator. If necessary, divide the denominator into the numerator then express the remaining fractional part as partial fractions.\r\n\r\nFor example, the numerator and denominator of \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x^{2}+7x+7}{\\left(x+1\\right)\\left(x+2\\right)} \\end{align*}\\] are of degree \\(2\\).

Look at the integrand2 The integrand of an integral is the function being integrated. For example the integrand of the integral \\[ \\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx \\] is \\(2x\\cos x^{2}\\). and see if one part of it is the derivative of another part multiplied by a constant. If so, substitution may be helpful. For example consider \\[ \\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx. \\] Note that the derivative of \\(x^{2}\\) is \\(2x\\) and so one part is the derivative of another part and substitution can be used. Even if we have the integral \\[ \\int x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx \\] the derivative of \\(x^{2}\\) is \\(2x\\). Since \\(x\\) is 1\/2 of the derivative of \\(x^{2}\\), substitution is still possible.\r\n\r\nExample 1: Calculate \\(\\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx\\)\r\nSolution: In this solution we use the second form of the substitution rule.3 \\[ \\int f\\left(u\\right)\\frac{du}{dx}dx=\\int f\\left(u\\right)du. \\]\r\n\r\nLet \\(u=x^{2}\\) then \\(\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)=\\cos\\left(u\\right)=f\\left(u\\right)\\) and \\(du\/dx=2x\\).

We set \\(u=2x+1\\)5 We will use the fact that \\[ \\left(2x+1\\right)^{5}=1\\times\\left(2x+1\\right)^{5}. \\] then \\(du\/dx=2\\)and so \\(1=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\). Note that when \\(x=0,\\) \\(u=1\\) and when \\(x=1,\\) \\(u=3.\\) Substituting into the integral we get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{0}^{1}\\left(2x+1\\right)^{5}dx &amp; =\\int_{0}^{1}1.\\left(2x+1\\right)^{5}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}.u^{5}dx\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{1}^{3}u^{5}du\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{6}\\left[u^{6}\\right]_{u=1}^{u=3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{12}\\left(3^{6}-1^{6}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{12}\\left(729-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{728}{12}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{182}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] Note the change of limits on the integration in line 3 as we are now integrating with respect to \\(u.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative notation\r\nIn many texts and possibly your lecture notes, you will find a slight change in notation. For example, consider the integral of Example 1 above: \\(\\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx.\\) As before we set \\(u=x^{2}\\) then \\(du\/dx=2x\\). The alternative notation then rearranges this to give \\(dx=\\frac{1}{2x}du\\). Then substituting for \\(x^{2}\\) and \\(dx\\) in the integral we get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int2x\\cos\\left(x^{2}\\right)dx &amp; =\\int2x\\cos\\left(u\\right)\\frac{1}{2x}du\\\\ &amp; =\\int\\cos\\left(u\\right)du\\\\ &amp; =\\sin\\left(u\\right)+c,\\;c\\textrm{ a constant}\\\\ &amp; =\\sin\\left(x^{2}\\right)+c. \\end{align*}\\] This method gives the same result and will always work. However, you should realize that \\(du\/dx\\) is not a fraction6 The derivative \\(du\/dx\\) is not a fraction. Remember that the derivative of a function \\(u\\left(x\\right)\\)is defined by the limit: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{du}{dx} &amp; =\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}\\frac{u\\left(x+h\\right)-u\\left(x\\right)}{h}. \\end{align*}\\] and you have no right to treat it like one when you rewrite \\(du\/dx\\) as \\(dx=\\frac{1}{2x}du\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nFind the following:\r\n\r\n \t\\(\\int\\left(5x+1\\right)^{4}dx\\)\r\n \t\\(\\int3x^{2}\\left(x^{3}+2\\right)^{5}dx\\)\r\n \t\\(\\int\\left(2x+1\\right)\\left(x^{2}+x+3\\right)^{3}dx\\)\r\n \t\\(\\int6x^{2}\\sqrt{\\left(x^{3}+3\\right)}dx\\)\r\n \t\\(\\int\\sin\\left(3x+2\\right)dx\\)\r\n \t\\(\\int6x^{2}e^{x^{3}}dx\\)\r\n \t\\(\\int\\frac{2x}{2+x^{2}}dx\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page, IN6:Integration by Substitution (PDF 164 KB) \r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"An expression that is composed of two functions (say an algebraic expression nested within a trigonometric expression) can be complicated to integrate.

The area is the absolute value of the signed areas: \\[ \\textrm{Area }=\\left|\\int_{a}^{b}f\\left(x\\right)dx\\right|. \\] In the general case where \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) crosses the \\(x\\)-axis between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) the value of the definite integral may be positive or negative.

Instead of saying c is a constant, we sometimes write \\(c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) which means \\(c\\) is a real number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProvided \\(n\\neq-1\\) then \\[ \\int x^{n}dx=\\frac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1}+c \\] where \\(c\\) is a constant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int xdx &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\\\ \\int x^{2}dx &amp; =\\frac{1}{3}x^{3}+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe question is, \" How do we deal with the case when \\(n=-1\\). That is, how do we integrate \\(\\int\\left(1\/x\\right)dx\\,\\)? The answer is we define a new function as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[ \\int\\frac{1}{x}dx=\\log_{e}\\left|x\\right|+c\\textrm{$\\quad\\textrm{where c is a constant.}$ } \\] This function, \\(\\log_{e}\\left|x\\right|\\), is called the \u201cnatural logarithm\u201d. It is sometimes written as \\(\\textrm{ln$\\left|x\\right|$ }\\). Note the use of the absolute value sign. The natural logarithm is not defined for negative arguments.\r\n\r\nWe can now integrate \\(f(x)=m\/x\\) where \\(m\\) is any constant: \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{m}{x}dx &amp; =m\\int\\frac{1}{x}dx\\\\ &amp; =m\\log_{e}\\left|x\\right|+c \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nFor example, the integral of \\(f(x)=\\frac{5}{x}\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is \\(\\int\\frac{5}{x}dx=5\\log_{e}\\left|x\\right|+c\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}.\\) There is a more general rule which covers more cases. It is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet \\(a\\) , b and \\(m\\) be constants with \\(a\\neq0\\), then \\[ \\int\\frac{m}{ax+b}dx=\\frac{m}{a}\\log_{e}\\left|ax+b\\right|+c \\] where \\(c\\) is a constant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tIntegrate \\(f(x)=\\frac{1}{2x}\\:\\)with respect to \\(x.\\;\\)2 Here, \\(m=1\\), \\(a=2\\) and \\(b=0\\).\r\nSolution: Using the rule \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{1}{2x}dx &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\log_{e}\\left|2x\\right|+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tCalculate the integral \\(\\int\\frac{2}{3x}dx\\) \\(\\;\\,\\)3 Here, \\(m=2\\), \\(a=3\\) and \\(b=0\\).\r\nSolution: Using the rule \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{2}{3x}dx &amp; =\\frac{2}{3}\\log_{e}\\left|3x\\right|+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tIntegrate \\(f(x)=\\frac{13}{5x-7}\\) with respect to \\(x.\\;\\) 4 Here, \\(m=13\\), \\(a=5\\) and \\(b=-7\\).\r\nSolution: Using the rule \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{13}{5x-7}dx &amp; =\\frac{13}{5}\\textrm{ln}\\left|5x-7\\right|+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tIntegrate \\(f(x)=\\frac{6}{2-3x}\\) with respect to \\(x.\\;\\) 5 Here, \\(m=6\\), \\(a=-3\\) and \\(b=2\\).\r\nSolution: Using the rule \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\frac{6}{2-3x}dx &amp; =\\frac{6}{-3}\\log_{e}\\left|2-3x\\right|+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\\\ &amp; =-2\\log_{e}\\left|2-3x\\right|+c. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tIntegrate \\(f(x)=\\frac{6}{2-3x}-\\frac{2}{x+1}\\) with respect to \\(x.\\;\\) 6 Here, \\(m=6\\), \\(a=-3\\) and \\(b=2\\) in the first term on the right hand side and \\(m=-2\\), \\(a=1\\) and \\(b=1\\)in the second.\r\nSolution: Using the rule \\[\\begin{align*} \\int\\left(\\frac{6}{2-3x}-\\frac{2}{x+1}\\right)dx &amp; =\\frac{6}{-3}\\log_{e}\\left|2-3x\\right|-2\\log_{e}\\left|x+1\\right|+c,\\quad c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\\\ &amp; =-2\\log_{e}\\left|2-3x\\right|-2\\log_{e}\\left|x+1\\right|+c \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n \tCalculate the following integrals\r\n\r\n\\[ \\begin{array}{cccccccccccc} a) &amp; \\int\\frac{1}{5x}dx &amp; &amp; b) &amp; \\int\\frac{3}{2x}dx &amp; &amp; c) &amp; \\int\\frac{3}{3x-5}dx &amp; &amp; d) &amp; \\int\\frac{6}{2-7x}dx\\end{array} \\]\r\n\r\n \tIntegrate the following functions with respect to \\(x\\):\r\n\r\n\\[ \\begin{array}{cccccccccccc} a) &amp; f(x)=x^{2}-2\/x &amp; &amp; b) &amp; f(x)=\\frac{1}{3x-2}+\\frac{3}{1-x} &amp; &amp; c) &amp; f(x)=\\frac{3}{3x-7}-x^{2} &amp; &amp; d) &amp; f(x)=\\frac{2}{5x-4}-\\frac{3}{2-5x}\\end{array} \\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe definite integral\r\nAnswers to all the integrals above were functions of \\(x\\) and involved a constant. Such integrals are called indefinite integrals or antiderivatives. They do not have a specific value.\r\n\r\nFor a function \\(f(x)\\) suppose we can write an antiderivative \\(F(x)=\\int f(x)dx\\).

We call \\(a\\) the lower limit of integration and \\(b\\) the upper limit of integration. The notation \\(\\left[F(x)\\right]_{a}^{b}\\) means substitute \\(x=b\\) and \\(x=a\\) into \\(F(x)\\) and then subtract the values.

If a matrix does not have an inverse, it is called singular.\r\n\r\nThis module describes how to find the inverse of a \\(3\\times3\\) matrix using elementary row operations.\r\n\r\nFinding the inverse\r\nIn theory, we use the matrix equation \\[\\begin{align*} {\\bf AB} &amp; ={\\bf I} \\end{align*}\\] and pre-multiply both sides by \\({\\bf A}^{-1}\\) (assuming it exists) to get \\[\\begin{align*} {\\bf A}^{-1}{\\bf AB} &amp; ={\\bf A}^{-1}{\\bf {\\bf I}}\\\\ {\\bf I}{\\bf B} &amp; ={\\bf A}^{-1}\\\\ {\\bf B} &amp; ={\\bf A}^{-1}. \\end{align*}\\] In practice, we form the augmented matrix \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[{\\bf A}|{\\bf I}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] and use elementary row operations to convert this to \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[{\\bf I}|{\\bf B}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] That is, for a \\(3\\times3\\) matrix we use elementary row operations to change \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13}\\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23}\\\\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] to \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{ccc} b_{11} &amp; b_{12} &amp; b_{13}\\\\ b_{21} &amp; b_{22} &amp; b_{23}\\\\ b_{31} &amp; b_{32} &amp; b_{33} \\end{array}\\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] the matrix \\[\\begin{align*} {\\bf B} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{ccc} b_{11} &amp; b_{12} &amp; b_{13}\\\\ b_{21} &amp; b_{22} &amp; b_{23}\\\\ b_{31} &amp; b_{32} &amp; b_{33} \\end{array}\\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] is then the inverse \\({\\bf A}^{-1}.\\)\r\n\r\nNote that there are other methods to determine the inverse but they are not considered here.\r\n\r\nElementary row operations\r\nElementary row operations are:\r\n\r\n \tMultiplication of a row by a constant;\r\n \tAddition and subtraction of a multiple of a row to another row;\r\n \tInterchanging two rows.\r\n\r\nWhen using elementary row operations to find the inverse, there is a preferred order as shown in Figure 1 below.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\underbrace{\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13}\\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23}\\\\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \\end{array}\\right]}_{\\text{1.

It is easier to see with specific numbers as in the following examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(1\\)\r\nFind the inverse of the matrix \\({\\bf A}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\).\r\nSolution\r\nSet up the augmented matrix \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[{\\bf A}|{\\bf I}\\right] &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] We now use row operations to reduce the matrix on the left hand side (LHS) to the identity matrix .\r\n\r\nReturning to our problem, we already have a \\(1\\) in the \\(a_{11}\\) position of the LHS matrix so we first make \\(a_{21}=a_{31}=0\\) as follows\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] &amp; \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}+R_{1}\\rightarrow R_{2}\\\\ R_{3}-R_{1}\\rightarrow R_{3} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] This completes Step \\(2\\) of figure \\(1\\) above.\r\n\r\nNow we want \\(a_{22}=1\\) in the LHS matrix. There are two ways to do this. We could divide \\(R_{2}\\) by \\(2\\) however this introduces a fraction that may be awkward (fractions are commonly required but we delay their use until necessary). The other way, which we will use, is to interchange \\(R_{2}\\) and \\(R_{3}\\) as shown below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] &amp; \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}\\rightarrow R_{3}\\\\ R_{3}\\rightarrow R_{2} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] This completes Step \\(3\\) figure \\(1\\) above and partially completes Step 4. Next we make \\(a_{32}=0\\) in the LHS matrix by subtracting \\(2R_{2}\\) from \\(R_{3}.\\) As a bonus this gives \\(a_{33}=1\\) in the LHS matrix:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] &amp; \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}-2R_{2}\\rightarrow R_{3} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] This completes Steps \\(4\\) and \\(5\\) of figure \\(1\\) above. Finally we make \\(a_{13}=a_{23}=0\\) using \\(R_{3}\\) as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] &amp; \\begin{array}{c} R_{1}-R_{3}\\rightarrow R_{1}\\\\ R_{2}-R_{3}\\rightarrow R_{2}\\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{ccc} -2 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ -4 &amp; -1 &amp; 3\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] This completes Step \\(6\\) of figure \\(1\\) above. The LHS matrix is the identity matrix and so the RHS is the inverse. That is \\[\\begin{align*} {\\bf A}^{-1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} -2 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ -4 &amp; -1 &amp; 3\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] You should always check that \\({\\bf A}{\\bf A}^{-1}={\\bf A}^{-1}{\\bf A}={\\bf I}.\\)1 Since in general, for matrices \\({\\bf A}\\)and \\({\\bf B},\\) \\[\\begin{align*} {\\bf A}{\\bf B} &amp; \\neq{\\bf B}{\\bf A} \\end{align*}\\] it is important to check both \\({\\bf A}{\\bf A}^{-1}={\\bf I}\\) and \\({\\bf A}^{-1}{\\bf A}={\\bf I}.\\)  We have \\[\\begin{align*} {\\bf A}{\\bf A}^{-1} &amp;

This is repeated until you obtain a remainder or zero and is illustrated below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nDivide \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) by \\(x-3.\\)\r\n\r\nFirst we set up the long division by writing\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nNow we start the algorithm: Divide, Multiply, Subtract and Bring down.\r\n\r\nDivide the highest power of the polynomial \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) by the highest power in the polynomial \\(x-3.\\) That is divide \\(x^{2}\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(x.\\) Place the \\(x\\) as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nMultiply \\(x-3\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(x^{2}-3x\\) and write the result as shown below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nSubtract \\(x^{2}-3x\\) from \\(x^{2}-5x\\) to get \\(-2x\\) as shown below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0\\,\\,\\,-2x\\phantom{)+6} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nBring down the \\(6\\) and write as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nWe now go back to the divide step and continue the algorithm until we get a remainder or zero.\r\n\r\nDivide \\(-2x\\) by the leading term in \\(x-3\\) to get \\(-2.\\) That is divide \\(x\\) into \\(-2x\\) to get \\(-2\\) and write the \\(-2\\) on the top line as shown below.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nMultiply \\(x-3\\) by \\(-2\\) to get\\(-2x+6\\) and write this as shown below.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{~\\phantom{()}(-2x+6)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nSubtract \\(-2x+6\\) from \\(-2x+6\\) to get \\(0.\\) This is the end of the process and, in this case there is no remainder.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-2x+6)} \\\\ 0+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nThis is the end of the process and, in this case, there is no remainder. That means that \\(x-3\\) divides \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) exactly and the answer is \\(x-2.\\) 4 Note that in this case it would be much easier to just factorise the quadratic or use the quadratic formula to get the same result. However, this is not available to us in general when the polynomials have higher degree. This is discussed in the next section. In other words \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x-2\\right) &amp; =x^{2}-5x+6. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDividing a higher order polynomial\r\nThe basic approach described above may be used on higher order polynomials. Generally the most common case is dividing a cubic polynomial by a linear polynomial We show this in the following example.\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nDivide \\(\\left(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\right)\\) by \\(\\left(x-1\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nFirst we write the long division as shown below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nWe then apply the steps of the algorithm: Divide, Multiply, Subtract, Bring down.\r\n\r\nDivide the highest term of \\(x-1\\) into the highest term of \\(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\). That is divide \\(x\\) into \\(x^{3}\\) to get \\(x^{2}\\) and write\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nMultiply \\(x^{2}\\) by \\(x-1\\) to get \\(x^{3}-x^{2}\\) and write as below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nSubtract \\(x^{3}-x^{2}\\) from \\(x^{3}-6x^{2}\\) to get \\(-5x^{2}\\)and write as:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2\\phantom{bbbi+11x)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nBring down the \\(11x\\) term and write as:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\phantom{\\,-5\\,x+6)x} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ \\, \\, -5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nDivide\r\n\r\nWe now repeat the algorithm. We divide the highest power of \\(x-1\\) into \\(-5x^{2}\\). That is, we divide \\(x\\) into \\(-5x^{2}\\) to get \\(-5x\\) and write as follows.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,\\,-5x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nMultiply \\(-5x\\) by \\(x-1\\) to get \\(-5x^{2}+5x\\) and write:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ \\, \\, -5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nSubtract \\(-5x^{2}+5x\\) from \\(-5x^{2}+11x\\) to get \\(6x\\) and write:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}}\\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ - \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)}\\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x \\phantom{)-6} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nBring down the \\(-6\\) and write as\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x\\phantom{)+6} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)}\\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nDivide the leading term of \\(x-1\\) into the leading term of \\(6x-6.\\) That is divide \\(x\\) into \\(6x\\) to get \\(6\\) and write as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}}\\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nMultiply \\(x-1\\) by \\(6\\) and write as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{\\phantom{()}(6x-6)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nSubtract \\(6x-6-\\left(6x-6\\right)\\) to get \\(0\\) and write as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2\\,-5\\,x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3-\\,\\, x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- \\, \\, 5x^2+11x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-5x^2+\\,\\,5x)}\\phantom{bbb)}\\\\ 6x-6 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(6x-6)} \\\\ 0+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nAs there are no more terms to bring down, we stop the algorithm. Our result is that \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\right)\\div\\left(x-1\\right) &amp; =x^{2}-5x+6. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThis is the same as \\[\\begin{align*} x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6=\\left(x^{2}-5x+6\\right)\\left(x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThis is probably the best interpretation as we can then factorise the quadratic term on the RHS to get \\[\\begin{align*} x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6 &amp; =\\left(x^{2}-5x+6\\right)\\left(x-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x-2\\right)\\left(x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Which is of value when we are trying to graph \\(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\) as it gives us the \\(x-\\)intercepts of the function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\nDivide \\(\\left(2x^{3}-3x+1\\right)\\) by \\(\\left(x-1\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nThe major difference from example 2 above is that there is no \\(x^{2}\\) term in \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}-3x+1. \\end{align*}\\] We get around this by writing \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}-3x+1 &amp; =2x^{3}+0x^{2}-3x+1 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThat is, we set up the long division as\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,2x^3+0x^2-3x+1\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nand apply the algorithm used in Example 1 and 2 above.\r\n\r\nApplying the algorithm we obtain:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} 2x^2+2x-1\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,2x^3+0x^2-3x+1\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(2x^3- 2x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbi)}}\\\\ 0+ \\, \\, 2x^2-3x\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(2x^2-2x)}\\phantom{bbb)} \\\\ 0-\\,\\, x\\,\\,+1 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-x\\,\\,+1)} \\\\ 0\\,\\,+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nHence we see that \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(2x^{3}-3x+1\\right)\\div\\left(x-1\\right) &amp; =2x^{2}+2x-1 \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}-3x+1 &amp; =\\left(2x^{2}+2x-1\\right)\\times\\left(x-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nIn your work, the final result as shown above is all that is required.

However the Factor Theorem is equally important.\r\n\r\nThe Factor Theorem states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf \\(P(x)\\) is a polynomial in \\(x\\) and \\(P(a)=0\\) then \\((x-a)\\) is a factor of \\(P(x)\\). We can use the factor theorem to find one factor of a polynomial, and then use polynomial long division to find the remaining factor(s).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 4\r\nSolve the equation \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24=0.\\)\r\n\r\nWe first use the Factor Theorem to try and get a linear factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24.\\) Let \\[ P\\left(x\\right)=x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24 \\] then letting \\(x=1,\\) \\[\\begin{align*} P\\left(1\\right) &amp; =1-5-2+24\\\\ &amp; =18\\\\ &amp; \\neq0 \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\left(x-1\\right)\\) is not a factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\).\r\n\r\nNow try \\(x=-1\\) to get, \\[\\begin{align*} P\\left(-1\\right) &amp; =-1-5+2+24\\\\ &amp; =20\\\\ &amp; \\neq0 \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\left(x-\\left(-1\\right)\\right)=\\left(x+1\\right)\\) is not a factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\).\r\n\r\nNow try \\(x=2\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} P\\left(2\\right) &amp; =8-20-4+24\\\\ &amp; =8\\\\ &amp; \\neq0 \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\left(x-2\\right)\\) is not a factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\).\r\n\r\nNow try \\(x=-2\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} P\\left(-2\\right) &amp; =-8-20+4+24\\\\ &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\left(x-\\left(-2\\right)\\right)=x+2\\) is factor of \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\). We now use polynomial division to divide \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\) by \\(x+2.\\) We have\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x^2-7x+12\\phantom{)} \\\\ x+2{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-5x^2-2x+24\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-(x^3+ 2x^2)\\phantom{bbbbbbbbbi)}} \\\\ 0- 7x^2 \\,-2x\\phantom{bbbbi)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-7x^2-\\!14x)}\\phantom{bbbi)} \\\\ 12x+24 \\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(12x+24)} \\\\ 0+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nThat is, \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24\\right)\\div\\left(x+2\\right) &amp; =\\left(x^{2}-7x+12\\right)\\\\ x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24 &amp; =\\left(x^{2}-7x+12\\right)\\left(x+2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] The quadratic on the RHS may be factorised as \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}-7x+12 &amp; =\\left(x-4\\right)\\left(x-3\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n5 This can be done by inspection, or more formally using the quadratic formula which says for a quadratic equation: \\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx+c &amp; =0,\\\\ x &amp; =\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}. \\end{align*}\\] In our case \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =\\frac{-\\left(-7\\right)\\pm\\sqrt{49-4\\left(1\\right)12}}{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{7\\pm\\sqrt{1}}{2}\\\\ &amp; =4\\text{ or $3$ .} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nand so \\[\\begin{align*} x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24 &amp; =\\left(x-4\\right)\\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x+2\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Hence the solutions to \\(x^{3}-5x^{2}-2x+24=0\\), are \\(x=4\\), \\(x=3\\) and \\(x=-2.\\)\r\n\r\nPlease try Exercise 2 below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 1\r\n\\(\\quad\\)a.

This variable is then substituted into the second equation to get an equation in one variable which may be solved. Once one variable is known, we can solve for the other variable.\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\nSolve the simultaneous equations \\(x+y=6\\) and \\(x-y=2\\).\r\nSolution\r\nFirst number the equations. \\[\\begin{align*} x+y &amp; =6 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ x-y &amp; =2. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nRearrange \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) to make \\(x\\) the subject: \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =6-y. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n3 Note that you can also make \\(y\\) the subject and proceed in the same way.

We use equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\): \\[\\begin{align*} x+2 &amp; =6\\\\ x &amp; =4 \\end{align*}\\] and the solution is \\(x=4\\text{ and }y=2\\) or \\(\\left(4,2\\right).\\) This may be checked by substituting in equations \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(2\\right).\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 4\r\nSolve the simultaneous equations \\(3x+2y=10\\) and \\(4x+3y=13\\).\r\nSolution\r\nFirst number the equations. \\[\\begin{align*} 3x+2y &amp; =10 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ 4x+3y &amp; =13. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nWe can make either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) the subject using equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) or \\(\\left(2\\right).\\) We will make \\(y\\) the subject. From \\(\\left(1\\right)\\), \\[\\begin{align*} 2y &amp; =10-3x\\\\ y &amp; =\\frac{10-3x}{2} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSubstitute in \\(\\left(2\\right)\\), \\[\\begin{align*} 4x+3\\left(\\frac{10-3x}{2}\\right) &amp; =13\\\\ 8x+3\\left(10-3x\\right) &amp; =26\\\\ 8x-9x &amp; =26-30\\\\ -x &amp; =-4\\\\ x &amp; =4. \\end{align*}\\] Now substitute for \\(x\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\), \\[\\begin{align*} 3\\times4+2y &amp; =10\\\\ 2y &amp; =-2\\\\ y &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(x=4,\\ y=-1\\) or \\(\\left(4,-1\\right).\\) This can be checked by substituting in equations \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(2\\right).\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraphical method\r\nIn the graphical method the straight line graph representing each equation is plotted on the same set of axes. The solution is the point of intersection of the two lines. The graphs must be plotted accurately for this method to give an accurate answer. For this reason it is not usually used unless specifically asked for.\r\n\r\nExample 5\r\nSolve the simultaneous equations \\(x+y=6\\) and \\(x-y=2\\) graphically.\r\nSolution\r\nGraphs representing each linear equation are drawn and the point of intersection is read from the graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solution is (\\(4,2\\)).\r\n\r\nCheck by substituting in each equation: \\(4+2=6\\) and \\(4-2=2\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEquations without solutions\r\nSome pairs of equations do not have a solution. Graphically this means that the two lines do not intersect.\r\n\r\nExample 6\r\nSolve the simultaneous equations \\(2x-y=6\\) and \\(-4x+2y=-7\\).\r\nSolution\r\nNumber the equations: \\[\\begin{align*} 2x-y &amp; =6 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ -4x+2y &amp; =-7. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] You can use any of the three methods above to try and solve the equations. We will use substitution. From \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =2x-6. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting into equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} -4x+2\\left(2x-6\\right) &amp; =-7\\\\ -4x+4x-12 &amp; =-7\\\\ -12 &amp; =-7. \\end{align*}\\] The last line is impossible and so we conclude no solution exists.\r\n\r\nWe show the graphs of equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) below. The two lines are parallel and never intersect, so no solution exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiple solutions\r\nSome pairs of simultaneous equations have multiple solutions. In this case, the equations have the same graph. That is one line lies on the other line.\r\n\r\nExample 7\r\nSolve \\(y=1-3x\\) and \\(6x=2(1-y)\\).\r\nSolution\r\nRearrange the equations so that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are on the same sides and number the equations: \\[\\begin{align*} 3x+y &amp; =1 &amp; \\left(1\\right)\\\\ 6x+2y &amp; =2. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Note that these two lines are the same because \\(\\left(2\\right)=2\\times\\left(1\\right).\\) Consequently they have the same graph and there are multiple values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that satisfy them. For example, setting \\(x=0\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) gives \\(y=1\\) so \\(\\left(0,1\\right)\\) is a solution. Setting \\(y=0\\) in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) gives \\(x=1\/3\\) and so \\(\\left(1\/3,0\\right)\\) is also a solution. In fact there are an infinite number of solutions, each corresponding to a point on the line \\(3x+y=1.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 1\r\nSolve simultaneously using either the elimination or substitution method:\r\n\r\n\\(1.\\ y=x-3\\text{ and $5x-2y=18.$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(2.\\ y=3x+4\\text{ and $2x+3y=23.$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(3.\\ 4x+y=23\\ \\text{and $x-y=2.$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(4.\\ -3x+2y=-4\\ \\text{and $5x-2y=8$ .}\\)\r\n\r\n\\(5.\\ 3x-5y=14\\ \\text{and $2x+y=5.$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(6.\\ 3x+2y=18\\ \\text{and $2x-5y=-7$ .}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 2\r\nSolve the following simultaneous equations graphically.\r\n\r\n\\(1.\\ y=x-3\\ \\text{and $x+y=5.$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(2.\\ 5x-y=8\\ \\text{and $2y-3x=-2.$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(3.\\ x+y=1\\ \\text{and $y-2x=7.$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page, ES2 Simultaneous Equations (PDF 247 KB) \r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"Two equations in two variables are said to be simultaneous if both must be considered at the same time.

In particular, we will consider the following transformations:\r\n\r\n \tReflection\r\n \tTranslation\r\n \tDilation\r\n \tCombinations of the above.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic graphs\r\nWhen attempting to graph a function, the following items need to be considered:\r\n\r\n \t\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) intercepts\r\n \tturning points\r\n \tbehavior as \\(x\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty\\)\r\n \tasymptotes. It is very useful to know the graphs of some simple functions. You can then transform them to more complex functions using the contents of this module. Below are some basic graphs that you should know.1 While it is best that you know these graphs, if you cannot recall them, you can still determine their graphs by plotting some points.\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph of \\(y=x\\)\r\nThis is a straight line with slope or gradient of \\(1.\\) It passes through the origin and is shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph of \\(y=x^{2}\\)\r\nThis is a parabola with vertex at the origin as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph of \\(y=x^{3}\\)\r\nThe essential feature is that the graph goes through the origin increases for positive \\(x\\) and decreases for negative \\(x.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph of \\(y=1\/x\\)\r\nThis is a graph with asymptotes at \\(x=0\\) and \\(y=0\\) (the \\(x-\\) axis) as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph of \\(y=a^{x}\\)\r\nThe basic graph is as shown below for \\(a=1.6\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe important thing to note is that the \\(y-\\) intercept is at \\(1\\) and doesn\u2019t depend on the value of \\(a\\) because \\(a^{0}=1.\\) Also the function cannot be less than zero so the negative \\(x-\\)axis is an asymptote. Changing the value of \\(a\\) will change the values on the \\(y-\\)axis but the basic shape of the graph is the same. In practice, the most common value of \\(a\\) is \\(e\\) and is most likely to come up in your course. So the graph above gives the basic shape of \\(y=e^{x}\\) but the \\(y-\\) axis values are incorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph of \\(y=\\log x\\)\r\nThe graph is shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe important characteristic is that the graph cuts the \\(x-\\) axis at \\(1\\) because \\(\\log\\left(1\\right)=0.\\) Note that this graph is similar for \\(\\ln\\left(x\\right)=\\log_{e}\\left(x\\right)\\) or any other log base .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransformations\r\nAs mentioned above, transformations may be used to modify basic graphs.

Nothing else changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDilations\r\nDilations stretch or compress a graph of a function. The stretching or compression can occur in the directions of either the \\(x\\) or the \\(y\\) axes, or both.\r\n\r\nThe graph of \\(y=af\\left(x\\right)\\) is a dilation of the graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) by a factor of \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d units in the direction parallel to the \\(y-\\)axis. If \\(a&gt;1\\) the graph is stretched or elongated. If \\(a&lt;1,\\)the graph is compressed or squashed.\r\n\r\nThe graph of \\(y=f\\left(bx\\right)\\) is a dilation of the graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) by a factor of \u201c\\(1\/b\\)\u201d units in the direction parallel to the \\(x-\\)axis. If \\(b&gt;1\\) the graph is compressed or squashed. If \\(b&lt;1,\\)the graph is stretched or elongated.\r\n\r\nExample \\(9\\): Dilation of \\(y=x^{2}\\) parallel to the \\(y-\\)axis by a factor of \\(4\\) and 1\/3\r\nThe graphs are shown below.\r\n\r\nThe original graph of \\(y=x^{2}\\) is shown in blue.\r\n\r\nThe dilation \\(y=4x^{2}\\) is shown in red and shows that the original graph is stretched parallel to the \\(y-\\) axis.\r\n\r\nThe dilation \\(y=\\frac{1}{3}x^{2}\\)is shown in green and shows that the original graph is squashed parallel to the \\(y-\\) axis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(10\\): Dilation of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) parallel to the \\(x-\\)axis by a factor of \\(2\\)\r\nThe graphs are shown below.\r\n\r\nThe original graph of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) is shown in blue. It has a period of \\(2\\pi.\\)\r\n\r\nThe dilation \\(y=\\sin\\left(2x\\right)\\) is shown in red and shows that the original graph is squashed by a factor of \\(2\\) parallel to the \\(x-\\) axis. The dilated graph has a period of \\(\\pi\\) which is half that of the original graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(11\\): Dilation of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) parallel to the \\(x-\\)axis by a factor of \\(1\/2\\)\r\nThe graphs are shown below.\r\n\r\nThe original graph of \\(y=\\sin\\left(x\\right)\\) is shown in blue. It has a period of \\(2\\pi.\\)\r\n\r\nThe dilation \\(y=\\sin\\left(0.5x\\right)\\) is shown in red and shows that the original graph is stretched parallel to the \\(x-\\) axis. The dilated graph has a period of \\(4\\pi\\) which is twice that of the original graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCombinations of transformations\r\nMore complicated graphs may be obtained from a basic graph by combining reflection, translation and dilation. In such cases you start with the basic graph and do the dilation first (if there is one). After this step, do translations and reflections in any order.\r\n\r\nExample \\(12\\): Graph of \\(y=2x^{3}+4\\)\r\nThe basic graph is \\(y=x^{3}.\\) We want to transform this to \\(y=2x^{3}+4.\\) This involves two transformations \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =\\underbrace{\\ 2\\ }_{\\text{Transformation1 }}x^{3}+\\underbrace{\\ 4\\ }_{\\text{Transformation 2}} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nTransformation \\(1\\) is a dilation of 2 parallel to the \\(y-\\)axis. It is a stretching of the original graph parallel to the \\(y-\\)axis.\r\n\r\nTransformation \\(2\\) is a translation of \\(4\\) units upward.\r\n\r\nThe basic graph to be transformed is \\(y=x^{3}\\) and is shown in blue below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe first do the dilation on this basic graph. That is we graph \\(y=2x^{3}\\). This is shown as the dashed blue graph below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally we do the translation of \\(4\\) units upwards to get the desired graph of \\(y=2x^{3}+4\\). This is shown in red below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only thing left to do is identify where the graph of \\(y=2x^{3}+4\\) intersects the \\(x-\\)axis. To do this we set \\(y=0\\) and solve for \\(x.\\) That is \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{3}+4 &amp; =0\\\\ 2x^{3} &amp; =-4\\\\ x^{3} &amp; =-2\\\\ x &amp; =-1.26. \\end{align*}\\] This information can be added to get the following figure:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur final answer is the red graph shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(13\\): Graph of \\(y=-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}-1\\)\r\nThe basic graph in this case is \\(y=x^{2}.\\) There are three transformations involved: \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =\\underbrace{-}_{\\text{Transformation 1}}\\underbrace{\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}}_{\\text{Tranformation 2 }}\\underbrace{-1}_{\\text{Transformation 3}} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nTransformation \\(1\\) is a reflection about the \\(x-\\)axis.\r\n\r\nTransformation \\(2\\) is shift of \\(y=x^{2}\\) to the left by \\(2\\)units.\r\n\r\nTransformation \\(3\\) is a shift of \\(1\\) unit downwards.\r\n\r\nAs there is no dilation, we are free to make the transforms on the basic graph in any order. In this example we will go from transformation \\(1\\) to \\(3\\) but the order does not matter.\r\n\r\nThe figure below shows the basic graph \\(y=x^{2}\\) in blue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransformation \\(1\\) reflects this in the \\(x-\\)axis. This is the graph of \\(y=-x^{2}\\) and is shown in dashed blue below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransformation 2 shifts the graph of \\(y=-x^{2}\\), \\(2\\) units to the left. This is the graph of \\(y=-\\left(x-2\\right)^{2}\\) and is shown in orange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransformation \\(3\\) shifts the graph of \\(y=-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}\\) down one unit. This is the desired graph of \\(y=-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}-1\\) and is shown below in red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intercept of the graph of \\(y=-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}-1\\) appears to at \\(\\left(0,-5)\\right)\\). This can be checked by setting \\(x=0:\\) \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}-1\\\\ &amp; =-\\left(0+2\\right)^{2}-1\\\\ &amp; =-5. \\end{align*}\\] The final graph of \\(y=-\\left(x+2\\right)^{2}-1\\) is shown below in red. We have marked the \\(y-\\)intercept at \\(\\left(0,-5\\right)\\) and the vertex at \\(\\left(-2,1\\right).\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample \\(14\\): Graph of \\(y=\\sqrt{-x}+2\\)\r\nThe basic graph is of \\(y=\\sqrt{x}\\) .\r\n\r\nThe graph of \\(y=\\sqrt{-x}+2\\) involves two transformations: \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =\\sqrt{\\underbrace{\\,-x}_{\\text{Transformation 1}}}+\\underbrace{\\,2}_{\\text{Transformation 2}}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nTransformation 1 is a reflection of the graph of \\(y=\\sqrt{x}\\) in the \\(y-\\)axis and is the graph of \\(y=\\sqrt{-x}\\).\r\n\r\nTransformation 2 is a translation of \\(2\\)units vertically up and gives the graph of \\(y=\\sqrt{x}+2\\).\r\n\r\nThe graphs of \\(y=\\sqrt{x}\\), \\(y=\\sqrt{-x}\\), and \\(y=\\sqrt{-x}+2\\) are shown below in blue, dashed blue and red, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nSketch the following graphs\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{1. }y=\\frac{2}{x+1}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{2. }y=\\log\\left(x+3\\right)\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{3. }y=x^{2}-25\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{4. }y=2-\\left(x+1\\right)^{2}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{5. }y=4^{x}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{6. }y=2e^{x}+1\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"The known graphs of some simple functions and relations can be used to sketch related, but more complicated functions.

Each case depends on the domain of the function. defined as follows:2 In what follows, \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is the set of real numbers.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R},\\textrm{where $f(x)=$ $\\left|x\\right|$ } &amp; =\\begin{cases} -x, &amp; x&lt;0\\\\ x &amp; x\\geq0 \\end{cases} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nwith graph\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe domain of \\(f(x)\\)=\\(\\left|x\\right|\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and the range of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}^{+}\\cup\\left\\{ 0\\right\\}\\). That is the set of all positive real numbers and zero.\r\n\r\nThe graph of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|\\) may be translated in the same way as the graphs of other functions. Compare the graphs of the following functions with that of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|\\)\r\n\r\n \tThe graph of \\(y=\\left|x-2\\right|\\) is shown below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand is the graph of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|\\) translated horizontally two units to the right. 3 The graph of \\(y=\\left|x+2\\right|\\) is the graph of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|\\) shifted two units to the left.\r\n\r\n \tThe graph of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|+1\\) is shown below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand is the graph of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|\\) translated vertically one unit up. 4 The graph of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|-1\\) is the graph of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|\\) translated vertically one unit down.\r\n\r\n \tThe graph of \\(y=3-\\left|x\\right|=-\\left|x\\right|+3\\) is shown below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand is the graph of \\(y=\\left|x\\right|\\) reflected in the \\(x\\) axis followed by a vertical shift of three units up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general, to sketch the graph of \\(y=\\left|f\\left(x\\right)\\right|\\), we need to sketch the graph of \\(y=f\\left(x\\right)\\) first and then reflect in the \\(x\\)-axis the portion of the graph which is below the \\(x\\)-axis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tSketch \\(\\left\\{ \\left(x,y\\right):y=\\left|x^{2}-1\\right|\\right\\}\\)\r\n\r\nThe graph of this function is the graph of \\(y=x^{2}-1\\) with the portion below the \\(x\\)-axis reflected in the \\(x\\)-axis and is shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEquations and inequalities involving \\(\\left|f\\left(x\\right)\\right|\\)\r\nBecause \\(y=\\left|f\\left(x\\right)\\right|\\) is a hybrid function, two cases must be considered when solving equations and inequalities.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tSolve \\(\\left|x-2\\right|=3\\)\r\n\r\nSolution\r\nIf \\(\\left|x-2\\right|=3\\) we must consider the two cases: \\[\\begin{align*} x-2 &amp; =3\\\\ x &amp; =3+2\\\\ &amp; =5 \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} x-2 &amp; =-3\\\\ x &amp; =-3+2\\\\ &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nHence the answer is \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3.\\)\r\n\r\n \tSolve \\(\\left|2x+1\\right|=\\left|x-5\\right|\\).\r\n\r\nSolution\r\nWith an absolute value expression on each side of the equation it is easier to square both sides.\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\left|2x+1\\right| &amp; =\\left|x-5\\right|\\\\ \\left(2x+1\\right)^{2} &amp; =\\left(x-5\\right)^{2}\\\\ 4x^{2}+4x+1 &amp; =x^{2}-10x+25\\\\ 4x^{2}+4x+1-x^{2}+10x-25 &amp; =0\\\\ 3x^{2}+14x-24 &amp; =0\\\\ (3x-4)(x+6) &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] So \\[\\begin{align*} 3x-4 &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =\\frac{4}{3} \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} x+6 &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =-6. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the answer is \\(x=4\/3\\) and \\(x=-6.\\)\r\n\r\n \tFind the set of \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(\\left|\\frac{2-x}{3}\\right|&lt;4\\).\r\n\r\nSolution\r\nCare must be taken when multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number. In such cases the inequality is reversed. The answer to this type of question is in fact a set as it involves an infinite number of solutions.\r\n\r\nWe have\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\left|\\frac{2-x}{3}\\right| &amp; &lt;4. \\end{align*}\\] Multiplying each side by \\(3:\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|2-x\\right| &amp; &lt;12 \\end{align*}\\] and so\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} -12&lt;2-x &amp; &lt;12. \\end{align*}\\] Adding \\(2\\) to all sides we get: \\[\\begin{align*} -14&lt;-x &amp; &lt;10. \\end{align*}\\] Multiplying by \\(-1\\), and noting the reversal of the inequality signs,\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} 14&gt;x &amp; &gt;-10\\,\\textrm{ or }-10&lt;x&lt;14. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the answer is that \\(x\\) is greater than \\(-10\\) but less than \\(14\\) \\(.\\) More formally, this may be expressed as a set \\[\\begin{align*} \\left\\{ x\\in\\mathbb{R}:-10&lt;x&lt;14\\right\\} . \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n \tFind the set of \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(\\left|\\frac{x-2}{3}\\right|\\geq2\\).\r\n\r\nSolution\r\nMultiply both sides by \\(3\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|x-2\\right| &amp; \\geq6. \\end{align*}\\] Hence \\[\\begin{align*} x-2 &amp; \\geq6\\\\ x &amp; \\geq8 \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} x-2 &amp; \\leq-6\\\\ x &amp; \\leq-4. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the answer is \\[\\begin{align*} \\left\\{ x:x\\leq-4\\right\\} &amp; \\cup\\left\\{ x:x\\geq8\\right\\} . \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 1\r\nEvaluate:\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{a) $\\left|-11\\right|\\quad\\text\r\n{b) $\\left|-9+4\\right|\\quad\\text{c) $-\\left|4\\right|-\\left|-5\\right|\\quad\\text{d) $\\left|-12\\right|-\\left|3\\right|\\quad\\text{e) $\\left|-30\\right|\\div\\left|5\\right|$ }$ }$ }$ }$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 2\r\nSketch the graph of\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{a) $y=\\left|x+4\\right|\\quad\\quad\\text{b) $y=\\left|x-1\\right|-3\\qquad\\text{c) $y=\\left|3-x^{2}\\right|$ }$ }$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 3\r\nFind for \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\)\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{a) $\\left\\{ x:\\left|x\\right|=6\\right\\} $ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{b) $\\left\\{ x:\\left|x-1\\right|&lt;3\\right\\} $ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{c) $\\left\\{ x:\\left|\\frac{x-3}{2}\\right|\\geq1\\right\\} $ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{d) $\\left\\{ x:\\left|\\frac{x}{2}\\right|=\\left|x+2\\right|\\right\\} $ }\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page, FG4 The Absolute Value Function (PDF 403 KB) \r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"The absolute value of a number x gives a measure of its size or magnitude regardless of whether it is positive or negative.

In this module, you'll learn about what functions and relations are and you can practice with the provided exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelations\r\nA relation is a set of ordered pairs.

For the above ordered pairs the range, ran = \\(\\left\\{ 2,4,6,y\\right\\}\\).\r\n\r\nThere is often a rule that links the domain and range.\r\n\r\nFor example: 1 The symbol \\(\\in\\) means \u201cis in\u201d or \u201cis an element of\u201d , the symbol \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) stands for the set of real numbers. The expression \\[\\begin{align*} x\\in &amp; \\mathbb{R} \\end{align*}\\] means that \u201cx is an element of the set of real numbers\u201d.

We usually write the symbol for the unit, such as kg for kilograms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSI units\r\nA physical quantity can be described with several different units. For instance, weight can be expressed in kilograms, grams, pounds, etc. To avoid confusion, scientists have introduced standard units for each physical quantity.

For example, expressing the diameter of an atom \\(\\left(0.0000000002\\textrm{ m}\\right)\\) in metres is challenging. Therefore, prefixes have been introduced to express such measurements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrefix\r\nSymbol\r\nMultiplied by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiga\r\n\\(G\\)\r\n\\(10^{9}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nmega\r\n\\(M\\)\r\n\\(10^{6}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nkilo\r\n\\(k\\)\r\n\\(10^{3}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\ndeci\r\n\\(d\\)\r\n\\(10^{-1}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\ncenti\r\n\\(c\\)\r\n\\(10^{-2}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nmilli\r\n\\(m\\)\r\n\\(10^{-3}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nmicro\r\n\\(\\mu\\)\r\n\\(10^{-6}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nnano\r\n\\(n\\)\r\n\\(10^{-9}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\npico\r\n\\(p\\)\r\n\\(10^{-12}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrefixes allow us to express the diameter of an atom in a more sensible way: \\(2 \\times 10^{\u201310}\\textrm{ m}\\). This representation of a physical quantity is called scientific notation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorked example \u2013 converting between units\r\nConvert the following quantities into the required units:\r\n\r\n\\(150.0\\textrm{ mg}\\) to grams\r\n\\(0.275\\textrm{ g}\\) to milligrams\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 1: Write a conversion factor. In this case, we know from the prefixes that:\r\n\\[ 1000\\textrm{ mg} = 1\\textrm{ g}\\]\r\nBoth \\(1000\\textrm{ mg}\\) and \\(1\\textrm{ g}\\) refer to the same amount, but use different units. Based on this relationship, we can create pair of conversion factors:\r\n\\[ \\frac{1000\\textrm{ mg}}{1\\textrm{ g}}\\:\\:\\textrm{and}\\:\\:\\frac{1\\textrm{ g}}{1000\\textrm{ mg}} \\]\r\n\r\nStep 2: Multiply the original quantity by the correct conversion factor. This is the conversion factor with the units we want in the numerator (top of the fraction) and the units we have in the denominator (bottom of the fraction).\r\n\r\nFor part a, we want to convert from mg to g. So, we need to use the conversion factor with g in the numerator: \\(\\frac{1\\textrm { g}}{1000\\textrm{ mg}}\\). This gives us:\r\n\\[ 150.0\\textrm{ mg}\\times\\frac{1\\textrm{ g}}{1000\\textrm{ mg}}=0.1500\\textrm{ g}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor part b, we want to convert from g to mg. So, we need to use the conversion factor with mg in the numerator: \\(\\frac{1000\\textrm{ mg}}{1\\textrm{ g}}\\). This gives us: \r\n\\[ 0.275\\textrm{ g}\\times\\frac{1000\\textrm{ mg}}{1\\textrm{ g}}=275\\textrm{ mg}\\]\r\n\r\nWhen you look at these two calculations, you can see that the conversion factor used from the pair depends on the required units.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour turn \u2013 converting between units\r\nWrite the conversion factors for the following:\r\n\r\n\r\ncentimetres and metres\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmicrolitres and millilitres\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseconds and hours\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConvert the following quantities into the required units:\r\n\r\n\\(250.0\\textrm{ mg}\\) to grams\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(0.567\\textrm{ mL}\\) to microlitres\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(14.8\\textrm{ mL}\\) to litres\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n0\u00baC to Kelvin (\\(K=\u00baC+273\\))\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Units are used to describe physical quantities.

Acids, with their sour taste and reactivity, are found in citrus fruits and vinegar, while bases, known for their bitter taste and slipperiness, appear in cleaning products and baking soda. When acids and bases react, they form salts, compounds that are essential in everything from seasoning food to preserving life through electrolytes. Understanding these compounds is key to grasping many chemical reactions and processes.\r\n\r\nAcids and bases can be easily classified based on their useful properties, but how are they defined from a chemical perspective?\r\n\r\nArrhenius acids and bases\r\nArrhenius' theory of acids and bases defines acids and bases in terms of their behaviour in water.\r\n\r\n\tAn Arrhenius acid is any substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions (\\(\\ce{H}^{+}\\)) in water. They do this by dissociating or breaking down into their constituent ions when dissolved in water. Arrhenius acids contain \\(\\ce{H}^{+}\\) ions.

Examples of Arrhenius bases are \\(\\ce{NaOH}\\) and \\(\\ce{KOH}\\). The equations for their dissociation in water are:\r\n\t\\[ \\ce{NaOH}(\\textrm{s})\\rightarrow\\ce{Na}^{+}(\\textrm{aq})+\\ce{OH}^{-}(\\textrm{aq}) \\] \\[ \\ce{KOH}(\\textrm{s})\\rightarrow\\ce{K}^{+}(\\textrm{aq})+\\ce{OH}^{-}(\\textrm{aq}) \\]\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations of Arrhenius' theory of acids and bases\r\nArrhenius's theory is limited to aqueous solutions, since it specifically defines acids and bases based on their behaviour in water. This theory cannot explain why compounds without hydroxyl groups behave as bases, such as ammonia generating a basic aqueous solution.\r\n\r\nBr\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base theory\r\nDue to the limitations of Arrhenius' theory of acids and bases, the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base theory was introduced.\r\n\r\n\tA Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid is any substance that can donate a hydrogen ion (or a proton) to another substance. It is called a proton because the hydrogen ion is a hydrogen atom that has lost its one electron, leaving behind a proton. Thus, a Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid is a proton donor and is denoted by \\(\\ce{HA}\\), where \\(\\ce{H}\\) is the hydrogen atom and \\(\\ce{A}\\) is the rest of the acid.\r\n\tA Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry base is any substance that can accept a hydrogen ion (or a proton) from another substance. To do this, it needs a lone pair of electrons. Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry bases are proton acceptors. They are denoted by \\(\\ce{B}\\colon\\), where \\(\\ce{B}\\) is the base and the \\(\\colon\\) is the lone pair of electrons. In some instances, they are simply denoted by \\(\\ce{B}\\).\r\n\r\n\r\nPolyprotic acids\r\nBr\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acids such as \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) and \\(\\ce{HNO3}\\) can donate one hydrogen ion, so they are called monoprotic acids. Some Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acids can donate multiple hydrogen ions. For example, \\(\\ce{H2SO4}\\) is capable of donating two hydrogen ions (diprotic acid), and \\(\\ce{H3PO4}\\) can donate three hydrogen ions (triprotic acid).\r\n\r\nAcidity of hydrogens\r\nNot all hydrogens are acidic. Only the hydrogens bound to highly electronegative atoms such as oxygen and chlorine can be released as protons or hydrogen ions. Hydrogens in \\(\\ce{HCl}\\), \\(\\ce{HNO3}\\), \\(\\ce{H2SO4}\\), and \\(\\ce{H3PO4}\\) are all acidic as the hydrogens are bound to electronegative \\(\\ce{Cl}\\) and \\(\\ce{O}\\). However, if you consider acetic acid, \\(\\ce{CH3COOH}\\), only one of the four hydrogens is acidic. This is the hydrogen atom connected to the highly electronegative atom, \\(\\ce{O}\\). The others are bound to \\(\\ce{C}\\).\r\nExamine the structures below and determine which of the hydrogens in each are acidic.\r\n \r\n\r\nAcid\u2013base reactions\r\nThe presence of a species that can accept protons (a base) is vital for the existence of a Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid, and vice versa. Proton donation and acceptance are complementary processes. The general equation of the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base reaction is:\r\n\\[ \\ce{HA}+\\ce{B}\\colon\\rightarrow\\ce{A}^{-}+\\left[\\ce{B}\\colon\\ce{H}\\right]^{+} \\]\r\nLet's look at two examples written in this format.\r\n\r\n \tWhen \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) gas dissolves\u00a0in water, \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) is the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid as it donates the proton to the water. The polar water molecule is the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry base as it accepts protons to become\u00a0a hydronium (\\(\\ce{H3O}^{+}\\)) ion. \r\n\t\\[ \\ce{HCl}(\\textrm{g})+\\ce{H2O}(\\textrm{l})\\rightarrow\\ce{Cl}^{-}(\\textrm{aq})+\\ce{H3O}^{+}(\\textrm{aq}) \\]\r\n \tWhen \\(\\ce{NH3}\\) gas reacts with \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) gas, \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) is the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry that donates a proton to \\(\\ce{NH3}\\). The ammonia molecules are the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry bases that accept the protons and become ammonium ions (\\(\\ce{NH}_{4}^{+}\\)).\r\n\t\\[ \\ce{HCl}(\\textrm{g})+\\ce{NH3}(\\textrm{g})\\rightarrow\\ce{Cl}^{-}(\\textrm{aq})+\\ce{NH}_{4}^{+}(\\textrm{aq}) \\]\r\n\r\n\r\nConjugate acid\u2013base pairs\r\nMany Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base reactions are reversible. After donating protons, acids are able to act as bases and accept protons. In the same way, after accepting a proton, bases can act as acids and donate the proton.\r\nLet's consider the general equation for the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid-base reaction. This reaction involves two acids and two bases:\r\n\\[ \\ce{HA}+\\ce{B}\\rightleftharpoons\\ce{HB}^{+}+\\ce{A}^{-} \\]\r\n\r\n\tIn the forward reaction, \\(\\ce{HA}\\) donates a proton to \\(\\ce{B}\\). So, \\(\\ce{HA}\\) functions as an acid and \\(\\ce{B}\\) functions as a base: \r\n\t\\[ \\ce{HA}+\\ce{B}\\rightarrow\\ce{HB}^{+}+\\ce{A}^{-} \\]\r\n\tIn the reverse reaction, \\(\\ce{HB}^{+}\\) donates a proton to \\(\\ce{A}^{-}\\). Therefore, \\(\\ce{HB}^{+}\\) functions as an acid and \\(\\ce{A}^{-}\\) functions as a base:\r\n\t\\[ \\ce{HB}^{+}+\\ce{A}^{-}\\rightarrow\\ce{HA}+\\ce{B} \\]\r\n\\(\\ce{HA}\\)\/\\(\\ce{A}^{-}\\) and \\(\\ce{B}\\)\/\\(\\ce{HB}^{+}\\) are referred to as conjugate acid\u2013base pairs. Conjugate acid\u2013base pairs are always present on opposite sides of the chemical equation. For instance, \\(\\ce{HA}\\) (acid) and \\(\\ce{A}^{-}\\) (conjugate base).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a conjugate acid\u2013base pair, the acid always has one more hydrogen atom than the base. For example, the reaction for the dissociation of \\(\\ce{CH}_{3}\\ce{COOH}\\) (acetic acid) in water is:\r\n\\[ \\ce{CH3COOH}+\\ce{H2O}\\rightleftharpoons\\ce{CH3COO}^{-}+\\ce{H3O}^{+} \\]\r\n\\(\\ce{CH3COOH}\/\\ce{CH3COO}^{-}\\) is a conjugate acid\u2013base pair. \\(\\ce{CH3COOH}\\) has one hydrogen atom more than the \\(\\ce{CH3COO}^{-}\\) ion. So, \\(\\ce{CH3COOH}\\) is the acid and \\(\\ce{CH3COO}^{-}\\) is base in the conjugate acid-base pair.\r\n\r\nWorked example \u2013 identifying Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acids and bases\r\nIdentify the following substances as a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid or base:\r\n\r\n\t\\(\\ce{HF}\\)\r\n\t\\(\\ce{PO}_{4}^{3-}\\).\r\n\r\nStep 1: Recall the definitions of a Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid and a Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry base.\r\nA Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid is any substance that can donate a hydrogen ion (or a proton) to another substance; they typically have one or more hydrogen atoms attached to a highly electronegative atom.

This hydrogen can be donated as \\(\\ce{H}^{+}\\).\r\n\t\\(\\ce{PO}_{4}^{3-}\\) does not contain hydrogen. However, oxygen atoms present in the phosphate ion have lone pairs of electrons which can be shared with hydrogen ions. Therefore, \\(\\ce{PO}_{4}^{3-}\\) is a Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry base.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorked example \u2013 identifying acid\u2013base conjugate pairs\r\nWrite the formula for the:\r\n\r\n \tconjugate base of \\(\\ce{H3PO4}\\)\r\n \tconjugate acid of \\(\\ce{NO}_{3}^{-}\\).\r\n\r\nStep 1: Write the equations for the dissociation of each acid or base.\r\n\r\n\t\\( \\ce{H3PO4}\\rightarrow\\ce{H}^{+}+\\ce{H2PO}_{4}^{-} \\)\r\n\t\\( \\ce{NO}_{3}^{-}+\\ce{H}^{+}\\rightarrow\\ce{HNO3} \\)\r\n\r\nStep 2: In a conjugate acid\u2013base pair, the acid always has one more hydrogen atom than the base. Therefore, the conjugate base is the species with one less hydrogen atom, and the conjugate acid is the species with one more hydrogen atom.\r\n\\(\\ce{H3PO4}\\) is an acid that donates a hydrogen ion to become \\(\\ce{H2PO}_{4}^{-}\\). Therefore, the conjugate base of \\(\\ce{H3PO4}\\) is the \\(\\ce{H2PO}_{4}^{-}\\) ion.\r\nAs a base, \\(\\ce{NO}_{3}^{-}\\) accepts a hydrogen ion to become \\(\\ce{HNO3}\\).

The strong acid has the capacity to completely (nearly 100%) dissociate in water to donate protons, which means its conjugate base has less affinity to protons as the reaction favours the formation of products. A base showing less affinity for protons is a weak base.\r\nSimilarly, in water, the weak acid partially dissociates to produce protons, which means its conjugate base displays a high affinity for the protons. The reaction favours the formation of reactants.\r\nTherefore, the stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base, and the weaker the acid, the stronger its conjugate base.\r\n\r\nIonisation constants\r\nThe strengths of acids and bases can be quantified using ionisation constants. These constants are essentially the ratio of products (dissociated acid or base) compared to reactants (undissociated acid or base).\r\n\r\nAcid ionisation constants \u2013 \\(K_{a}\\)\r\nRecall that the dissociation of a weak acid in water can be written as:\r\n\\[\\ce{HA}(\\textrm{aq})+\\ce{H2O}(\\textrm{l})\\rightleftharpoons\\ce{H3O}^{+}(\\textrm{aq})+\\ce{A}^{-}(\\textrm{aq})\\]\r\nOnce the concentrations of \\(\\ce{H3O}^{+}\\), \\(\\ce{A}^{-}\\) and \\(\\ce{HA}\\) are experimentally determined, the acid ionisation constant (\\(K_{a}\\)) can be calculated using:\r\n\\[K_{a}=\\frac{ \\textrm{[}\\ce{H3O}^{+}\\textrm{]} \\textrm{[}\\ce{A}^{-}\\textrm{]} }{\\textrm{[}\\ce{HA}\\textrm{]}} \\]\r\nThe strength of an acid is directly proportional to the acid ionisation constant&mdash;that is, the higher the constant, the stronger the acid. Strong acids have larger \\(K_{a}\\) values (greater than \\(1\\)), as the formation of products is favoured; there is a larger concentration of \\(\\ce{H3O}^{+}\\) and \\(\\ce{A}^{-}\\) than \\(\\ce{HA}\\), Weak acids have \\(K_{a}\\) values less than \\(1\\), as ionisation is not favoured.\r\nWater is not included in the ionisation constant expression because it is the solvent and its concentration is effectively constant.\r\n\r\nBase ionisation constants \u2013 \\(K_{b}\\)\r\nRecall that the dissociation of a weak base in water can be written as:\r\n\\[\\ce{B}(\\textrm{aq})+\\ce{H2O}(\\textrm{l})\\rightleftharpoons\\ce{BH}^{+}(\\textrm{aq})+\\ce{OH}^{-}(\\textrm{aq})\\]\r\nThe strength of a base can also be predicted by an ionisation constant, the base ionisation constant (\\(K_{b}\\)). The general expression for \\(K_{b}\\) is:\r\n\\[K_{b}=\\frac{ \\textrm{[}\\ce{BH}^{+}\\textrm{]} \\textrm{[}\\ce{OH}^{-}\\textrm{]}  } {\\textrm{[}\\ce{B}\\textrm{]}} \\]\r\n\r\nWorked example \u2013 determining ionisation constants\r\nThe weak acid \\(\\ce{HA}\\) in \\(0.0200\\textrm{M}\\) solution is \\(10\\%\\) ionised. Determine the acid ionisation constant.\r\nStep 1: Write an equation for the ionisation of the acid.\r\n\\[\\ce{HA}(\\textrm{aq})+\\ce{H2O}(\\textrm{l})\\rightleftharpoons\\ce{H3O}^{+}(\\textrm{aq})+\\ce{A}^{-}(\\textrm{aq}) \\]\r\nStep 2: Recall the expression for \\(K_{a}\\).\r\n\\[K_{a}=\\frac{ \\textrm{[}\\ce{H3O}^{+}\\textrm{]} \\textrm{[}\\ce{A}^{-}\\textrm{]} }{\\textrm{[}\\ce{HA}\\textrm{]}} \\]\r\nStep 3: Calculate the concentrations of \\(\\ce{H3O}^{+}\\), \\(\\ce{A}^{-}\\) and \\(\\ce{HA}\\) using the percentage ionisation.\r\nThe concentration of \\(\\ce{H3O}^{+}\\) will be \\(10\\%\\) of the original concentration of \\(\\ce{HA}\\).\r\n\\[\\begin{align*}\r\n\\textrm{[}\\ce{H3O}^{+}\\textrm{]} &amp; = 10\\% \\times 0.0200\\textrm{M}\\\\\r\n&amp; = 0.0200\\textrm{M}\r\n\\end{align*} \\]\r\nUsing the molar ratio:\r\n\\[\\begin{align*}\r\n\\textrm{[}\\ce{A}^{-}\\textrm{]} &amp; = \\frac{1}{1} \\times \\textrm{[}\\ce{H3O}^{+}\\textrm{]}\\\\\r\n&amp; = 0.00200\\textrm{M}\r\n\\end{align*} \\]\r\nSince the concentrations are molar, \\(\\textrm{[}\\ce{H3O}^{+}\\textrm{]} + \\textrm{[}\\ce{HA}^{+}\\textrm{]} = \\textrm{[}\\ce{A}^{-}\\textrm{]}\\). We can calculate:\r\n\\[\\begin{align*}\r\n\\textrm{[}\\ce{HA}\\textrm{]} &amp; = 0.0200\\textrm{M}-0.00200\\textrm{M}\\\\\r\n&amp; =0.0180\\textrm{M}\r\n\\end{align*}\\]\r\nStep 4 Substitute the concentration values into the acid ionisation constant expression:\r\n\\[\\begin{align*}\r\nK_{a} &amp; =\\frac{\\textrm{[}\\ce{H3O}^{+}\\textrm{]}\\textrm{[}\\ce{A}^{-}\\textrm{]}}{\\textrm{[}\\ce{HA}\\textrm{]}}\\\\\r\n&amp; =\\frac{0.00200\\textrm{M}\\times0.00200\\textrm{M}}{0.0180\\textrm{M}}\\\\\r\n&amp; =2.2\\times10^{-4}\r\n\\end{align*}\\]\r\nStep 5: Include the correct units.\r\nThe units for ionisation constants can vary. In this case, the numerator has \\(\\textrm{M}\\times\\textrm{M}\\) and the denominator has just \\(\\textrm{M}\\). \\(\\frac{\\textrm{M}^{2}}{\\textrm{M}}=\\textrm{M}\\), so the units for this example are just \\(\\textrm{M}\\).

Such fractions are common in mathematics and engineering.\r\nMore complicated algebraic fractions can involve polynomials of any order.\r\n\r\nHowever in your studies, it is unlikely that you will have to deal with polynomials higher than quadratics. 1 A quadratic is a a polynomial of degree 2 and has the general form: \\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx &amp; +c \\end{align*}\\] where \\(a,b,c\\) are constants.\r\n\r\nIn this module, we consider algebraic fractions involving quadratics.\r\n\r\nThere is no general theory for this so we proceed via examples. Please note that algebraic fraction may exclude certain values of \\(x.\\) This is to ensure we never get a zero denominator. 2 The numerator is the top expression in the fraction. For \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{a}{b} \\end{align*}\\] \\(a\\) is the numerator. The bottom expression is called the denominator. Here \\(b\\) is the denominator.\r\n\r\nThe concept of a common denominator is fundamental to algebraic fractions.3 Before you can add or subtract two fractions you need to have a common denominator. For example, to determine \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2}{3}-\\frac{1}{2} \\end{align*}\\] we have to convert each fraction into sixths as a common multiple of \\(3\\) and \\(2\\) is \\(6\\). Therefore \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2}{3}-\\frac{1}{2} &amp; =\\frac{4}{6}-\\frac{3}{6}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{4-3}{6}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{6}. \\end{align*}\\] The same concept is necessary for algebraic fractions.\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nDetermine \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2}{x^{2}+x-12}-\\frac{1}{x^{2}-9}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nYou could use \\(\\left(x^{2}+x-12\\right)\\times\\left(x^{2}-9\\right)\\) as a common denominator and work from there.

It enables you to divide two numbers that may be quite large. It is also possible to use long division on polynomials so that they can be factorised. Cubic polynomials are the most common. Find out how to write \\[x^3-5x^2-2x+24=\\left(x-4\\right)\\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x+2\\right).\\] This type of factorisation is useful for graphing the cubic polynomial.\r\n\r\n1 An integer is a positive or negative whole number and may include \\(0.\\) For example in the case that the result was an integer we could have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis means that \\(6750\\div15=450\\) or \\(6750=15\\times450.\\)\r\n\r\nIn case the numbers do not exactly divide we could have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis means that \\[\\begin{align*} 6751\\div15 &amp; =450+\\frac{1}{15} \\end{align*}\\] or, in decimal form, \\[\\begin{align*} 6751\\div15 &amp; =450.0\\overline{6} \\end{align*}\\] where the over-bar on the \\(6\\) indicates it repeats.\r\n\r\nIn the age of calculators, long division of numbers is not so important. However it is still useful in factorising cubic (and higher degree) polynomials.2 The degree of a polynomial is the highest power to which the variable is raised. For example, \\[\\begin{align*} 5x^{4}+2x^{2}-3 \\end{align*}\\] is a polynomial of degree \\(4.\\) Polynomials of degree \\(1,2\\), \\(3\\) and \\(4\\) are called linear, quadratic, cubic and quartic respectively.  This module describes how to divide a polynomial by a polynomial of lower degree using long division.\r\n\r\nThe basic approach\r\nFor long division, a useful algorithm, whether for numbers or polynomials is Divide, Multiply, Subtract, Bring Down.3 An algorithm is a series of instructions. If you look at long division on the web, you may find some differences. This is repeated until you obtain a remainder or zero and is illustrated below:\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nDivide \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) by \\(x-3.\\)\r\n\r\nFirst we set up the long division by writing\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nNow we start the algorithm: Divide, Multiply, Subtract and Bring down.\r\nDivide\r\nDivide the highest power of the polynomial \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) by the highest power in the polynomial \\(x-3.\\) That is divide \\(x^{2}\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(x.\\) Place the \\(x\\) as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\nMultiply\r\nMultiply \\(x-3\\) by \\(x\\) to get \\(x^{2}-3x\\) and write the result as shown below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\end{array}\\]\r\nSubtract\r\nSubtract \\(x^{2}-3x\\) from \\(x^{2}-5x\\) to get \\(-2x\\) as shown below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0\\,\\,\\,-2x\\phantom{)+6} \\end{array}\\]\r\nBring down\r\nBring down the \\(6\\) and write as follows:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x\\phantom{)-2} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nWe now go back to the divide step and continue the algorithm until we get a remainder or zero.\r\nDivide\r\nDivide \\(-2x\\) by the leading term in \\(x-3\\) to get \\(-2.\\) That is divide \\(x\\) into \\(-2x\\) to get \\(-2\\) and write the \\(-2\\) on the top line as shown below.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\nMultiply\r\nMultiply \\(x-3\\) by \\(-2\\) to get\\(-2x+6\\) and write this as shown below.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{~\\phantom{()}(-2x+6)} \\end{array}\\]\r\nSubtract\r\nSubtract \\(-2x+6\\) from \\(-2x+6\\) to get \\(0.\\) This is the end of the process and, in this case there is no remainder.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} x-2\\phantom{)} \\\\ x-3{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^2-5x+6\\phantom{)}}} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{(}(x^2-3x)\\phantom{-b)}} \\\\ 0-2x+6\\phantom{)} \\\\ \\underline{-~\\phantom{()}(-2x+6)} \\\\ 0+0\\phantom{)} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nThis is the end of the process and, in this case, there is no remainder. That means that \\(x-3\\) divides \\(x^{2}-5x+6\\) exactly and the answer is \\(x-2.\\) In other words4 Note that in this case it would be much easier to just factorise the quadratic or use the quadratic formula to get the same result. However, this is not available to us in general when the polynomials have higher degree. This is discussed in the next section. \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x-2\\right) &amp; =x^{2}-5x+6. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDividing a higher order polynomial\r\nThe basic approach described above may be used on higher order polynomials. Generally the most common case is dividing a cubic polynomial by a linear polynomial We show this in the following example.\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nDivide \\(\\left(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\right)\\) by \\(\\left(x-1\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nFirst we write the long division as shown below:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{r} \\\\ x-1{\\overline{\\smash{\\big)}\\,x^3-6x^2+11x-6\\phantom{)}}} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\nWe then apply the steps of the algorithm: Divide, Multiply, Subtract, Bring down.\r\nDivide\r\nDivide the highest term of \\(x-1\\) into the highest term of \\(x^{3}-6x^{2}+11x-6\\).

The method of partial fractions involves breaking up an algebraic fraction into simpler parts that are added together. This is useful in integration and in finding inverse Laplace and Fourier transforms.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdding fractions\r\nTo add fractions, we rewrite the fractions with common denominator and then add the numerators.\r\n\r\nFor example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{3}{3x+4}+\\frac{2}{x-5} &amp; =\\frac{3}{(3x+4)}\\times\\frac{(x-5)}{(x-5)}+\\frac{2}{(x-5)}\\times\\frac{(3x+4)}{(3x+4)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3(x-5)}{(3x+4)(x-5)}+\\frac{2(3x+4)}{(3x+4)(x-5)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3(x-5)+2(3x+4)}{(3x+4)(x-5)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3x-15+6x+8}{(3x+4)(x-5)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{9x-7}{(3x+4)(x-5)}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding partial fractions\r\nThe reverse of this process is to split a fraction into partial fractions.\r\n\r\nIn the above example,1 The partial fractions are \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{3}{3x+4} \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\dfrac{2}{x-5}\\,. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\dfrac{9x-7}{(3x+4)(x-5)} &amp; =\\dfrac{3}{3x+4}+\\dfrac{2}{x-5}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe first step in finding partial fractions is to factorise the denominator. The factorisation will determine the form of the partial fractions: \\[\\begin{align*} 1.\\, &amp; \\text{Distinct linear factors$\\quad$ }\\frac{mx+k}{(x+a)(x+b)}=\\frac{A}{x+a}+\\frac{B}{x+b}\\\\ 2.\\, &amp; \\text{Repeated linear factors$\\quad$ }\\frac{mx+k}{(x+a)^{2}}=\\frac{A}{x+a}+\\frac{B}{(x+a)^{2}}\\\\ 3.\\, &amp; \\text{Quadratic and linear factor$\\quad$ }\\frac{mx+k}{(ax^{2}+bx+c)(px+q)}=\\frac{Ax+B}{ax^{2}+bx+c}+\\frac{C}{px+q}. \\end{align*}\\] The last step is to determine the constants \\(A,\\,B\\) and \\(C.\\) This is discussed in a later section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples of partial fractions\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2x+1}{x^{2}+3x+2} &amp; =\\frac{2x+1}{(x+2)(x+1)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{A}{x+2}+\\frac{B}{x+1}\\\\ \\\\ \\frac{x-7}{(2x-1)(x^{2}+4x+4)} &amp; =\\frac{x-7}{(2x-1)(x+2)^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{A}{2x-1}+\\frac{B}{x+2}+\\frac{C}{(x+2)^{2}}\\\\ \\\\ \\frac{x-7}{(2x-1)(x^{2}+4x+5)} &amp; =\\frac{A}{2x-1}+\\frac{Bx+C}{x^{2}+4x+5} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nNote that \\(x^{2}+4x+5\\) cannot be factorised into two linear factors.\r\n\r\nImportant point\r\nThe process of finding partial fractions can only be performed on fractions where the degree of the numerator of the algebraic fraction is less than the degree of the denominator (that is, the greatest power of \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d on the top of the fraction must be less than the greatest power of \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d on the bottom of the fraction). If necessary, divide the denominator into the numerator and then express the remaining fractional part as partial fractions.\r\n\r\nFor example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\dfrac{x^{2}+7x+7}{x^{2}+3x+2} &amp; =1+\\dfrac{4x+5}{x^{2}+3x+2}\\\\ &amp; =1+\\dfrac{4x+5}{(x+2)(x+1)}\\\\ &amp; =1+\\dfrac{3}{x+2}+\\dfrac{1}{x+1}\\quad\\text{(After calculating partial fractions)} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 1\r\nRewrite each of the following in the appropriate generalised partial fraction form (do not calculate the constants).\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{a)$\\;$ $\\dfrac{x+6}{2x^{2}+5x-12}\\qquad\\text{b)$\\;\\dfrac{2x}{(x^{2}+3)(x+1)}$ }$ }\\)\r\n\r\n\\(\\text{c)$\\;$ $\\dfrac{2x}{x^{2}+8x+16}$ $\\qquad\\text{d)$\\;$ $\\dfrac{x^{2}}{x^{2}-1}$ .}$ }\\)2 Hint: If the power of \\(x\\) in the numerator is greater than or equal to that of the denominator, first perform a long division and then factorise the resulting algebraic fraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDetermining the constants\r\nThe constants \\(A,\\,B\\) and \\(C\\) are determined using simultaneous equations or substitution of particular values of \\(x.\\) Both these methods are explained in the following examples.\r\n\r\nExample 1: Simultaneous equations\r\nExpress \\(\\dfrac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3}\\) as a sum of partial fractions.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} &amp; =\\frac{x-5}{(x-1)(x+3)} \\end{align*}\\] This is a case of distinct linear factors so \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-5}{x^{2}+2x-3} &amp; =\\frac{x-5}{(x-1)(x+3)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{A}{x-1}+\\frac{B}{x+3} &amp; \\left(1.1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{A(x+3)}{(x-1)(x+3)}+\\frac{B(x-1)}{(x-1)(x+3)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{A(x+3)+B(x-1)}{(x-1)(x+3)}. &amp; \\left(1.2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] From equation \\(\\left(1.1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(1.2\\right)\\),\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} x-5 &amp; =A(x+3)+B(x-1) &amp; \\left(1.3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =Ax+3A+Bx-B\\\\ &amp; =(A+B)x+(3A-B). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nEquating terms involving \\(x\\) and constants on the LHS and RHS gives: \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =(A+B)x\\\\ 1 &amp; =A+B\\text{ assuming $x\\neq0,$ } &amp; \\left(1.4\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} -5 &amp; =3A-B\\:. &amp; \\left(1.5\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nEquations \\(\\left(1.4\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(1.5\\right)\\) may be solved simultaneously.3 There are several way of doing this.

Visit RMIT\u2019s website, which is www.rmit.edu.au. Select the student link at the top of your screen in the navigation bar.\r\n\r\n[Music continues]\r\n\r\nOnce you click on the Canvas link, you will be redirected to a login portal to access your personal RMIT section of the website. Login using your student number and password. When you are ready, click login.\r\n\r\nThe dashboard is the first think you will see when you log in to Canvas. The dashboard helps you see what is happening in all of your current courses. On the right side, you will see any work you need to complete, feedback, grades you have received and any upcoming events.\r\n\r\nThe global navigation menu is located on the left side of every page in Canvas. The global navigation links provide quick access to frequently used Canvas features. You can return to your dashboard at any time by clicking the dashboard link in the global navigation.\r\n\r\nThe first link in the global navigation is where you will find your Canvas account settings. In here, you can upload your profile picture and adjust your notification preferences. Canvas allows you to customise how you receive notifications from all of your courses. You can add different contact methods to receive notifications. So, it\u2019s just announcements and grades to your mobile number, the Canvas app or an alternative email address.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important that you spend time reviewing your notifications. And, in particular, make sure you have announcements turned on. This ensures you receive any information from your teachers straight away. For more information on setting up your notifications, see the links to the guide below the video.\r\n\r\nWhen you are ready, select your dashboard, and then click into the course you want to view. First is your homepage, which will be the first think you seen in your course. Next up, you\u2019ll have announcements which will have any messages from your teachers. After that it\u2019s your course syllabus. This contains the course summary, including topics, readings and assessment dates.\r\n\r\nIn a course, all your learning materials will be located in modules. Each module can contain files, discussions, assignments and other resources. You can select modules from the course navigation. And once you are there, you will be able to see a welcome module with introduction information and course resources organised according to the course delivery.\r\n\r\nIn Canvas, all your assessments information can be found in the assignment link. By clicking on the link, you get a list of all your assessment tasks for the course. When you click on the name of an assessment, it will display all information from the teachers about the task, including the due date and the rubric. It will also allow you to submit your assessment when the time comes. And finally, this is where you will be able to see your grades and view your feedback.\r\n\r\nIf you ever run into any trouble, you can always reach out to Canvas support. They are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You can find all your help options in the help link in the Canvas global navigation. Plus, you can always speak to your teacher.\r\n\r\nCanvas also has a student app, which you can download for free from the App Store. Canvas mobile apps for iOS and android gives you access to your course whenever you need it and wherever you are. You\u2019ll see the dashboard where you can access information in each of your courses and information about any groups that you are in.\r\n\r\nUsing the menu at the bottom of the screen, you can access your dashboard, calendar, task list, notifications and inbox. The app is really easy to use, and it means you can get updates, announcements and notifications instantly. You can participate in discussions when you are out and about. And it\u2019s a great way to get all your reading done on the train. You can also access all of your assignments easily and view the calendar or task list to check what assignments are due soon.\r\n\r\nGood luck and welcome to Canvas.\r\n\r\n[Music continues]\r\n\r\n[End transcript]\r\n","excerpt":"Maximise your university experience by learning how to put your best foot forward online and get the most out of your online classes.

In this video I'm going to give you some tips on how to make a good impression online. It's important to remember that university is an academic and professional space. You could be studying among future employers or colleagues.\r\n\r\nSo how can you put your best foot forward online? When you're speaking, it's nice to turn your camera on if you can, so that your classmates and teacher can get to know you. Position the camera so that you are facing straight on, it might help to prop your laptop or computer up with a stand or some books. Try sitting in front of a window so that the natural sunlight lights your face. Think about your background. What's behind you? Can you angle yourself so that you have a neutral background? Of course, it's not always possible to turn your camera on or sit in front of a window or have a nice background but just do your best and don't let this stop you from contributing in class.\r\n\r\nIt's also helpful to mute your microphone when you aren't speaking. This minimises the background noise for everyone else. If your teacher puts you in a breakout room, it can help you to engage with your group members if you switch your camera on. If you can't switch your camera on, that's OK! Just let your group members know that you're still there, you're listening, and you're ready to talk.\r\n\r\nAlways try to be culturally sensitive and use inclusive language when you speak to your classmates and teachers. Be aware of making jokes and using sarcasm as humour can easily be misinterpreted online. Avoid using slang words as not everyone may understand these. And never use offensive language! Proofread what you type before you press send. And remember, the main class chat is not a place to have private discussions! Whether you are typing a message in the class chat, giving a presentation, responding on a discussion board, or speaking aloud in an online class, remember to be polite and respect others' points of view. Show people the same courtesy online that you would in person.\r\n\r\nSo, use these tips. Make the most of your online classes and join in! Contribute your ideas and listen to others. Ask questions and remember there are lots of places in the university where you can ask for support such as the Library, IT, and Student Connect.\r\n\r\nI hope these tips have been helpful. See you later!\r\n","excerpt":"Are you new to online study? Want to discover some strategies for effective online learning? Here are some tips for maximising your online class time.

After all, what is more important than the safety of our families? Critics, generally made up of people who have never served their country, argue that conscription is an outdated and coercive practice, but they overlook the significant benefits it can bring to both individuals and the nation. Countries with mandatory conscription have stronger, more resilient defence forces. By requiring all eligible young adults to serve, Australia would ensure a steady influx of trained personnel, ready to respond to any threats. Furthermore, conscription fosters discipline, teamwork, and a sense of responsibility, qualities that are invaluable in both military and civilian life.\r\n\r\nMandatory conscription can serve as a powerful equaliser in society, providing opportunities for personal growth and development that might otherwise be inaccessible. Research published in the Journal of Military and Strategic Studies indicates that conscription programmes often lead to increased social cohesion and a greater understanding of national values. A common concensus across a number of researchers suggests that young Australians from diverse backgrounds would come together, breaking down social barriers and building lasting bonds. Critics who claim that conscription disrupts education and career plans fail to recognise the long-term advantages of the skills and experiences gained through military service. In fact, I would say that the vast majority of former conscripts would say that their time in the military was instrumental in shaping their future success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"The exercise on this page gives you the chance to practice and sharpen your argument analysis skills.

Understanding the basics of using these online tools to share, edit, and save documents will be extremely useful to your future working life and make group assignments easier and more efficient.\r\nWhat is an online collaboration platform?\r\nAn online collaboration platform is a digital workspace, which allows people to collaborate no matter where they are. Online platforms often include cloud storage and office applications, and sometimes chat, email, and online forums. Some examples are Microsoft 365 and Google Drive.\r\nWhat is a co-authoring tool?\r\nCo-authoring files can be stored in the cloud and shared with other people so that real-time reviewing and editing can take place, like it would in an office or classroom. These tools generally include features such as autosave, comments, track changes, user tagging, version history, and notifications. For example, Microsoft Word and Google Docs co-authoring tools allow multiple people to work on the same file at the same time.\r\nKey terms\r\nWhile collaborating online, you will likely come across the following key terms:\r\nLocal file: A digital file stored on your personal computer.\r\nCloud file: A digital file stored on internet servers (the cloud) rather than on your computer, which can be kept private or shared with others.\r\nCo-authoring: Collaborative authoring (working on a document together at the same time).\r\nReal-time editing: Working together on a document at the same time rather than working individually and sending updates.\r\nCollaboration steps\r\nBy following these three steps, you will be able to set your group up for online collaboration success.\r\nStep 1: Decide as a group which collaboration platform and tools you are going to use.\r\nStep 2: Create your online collaboration space.\r\nStep 3: Start creating, sharing, and co-authoring your work as a group.\r\nChoosing your collaboration tools\r\nRemember that the best option for a collaboration tool is the one which suits the whole group.

When you read from a script, your voice can become robitic and the lack emphasis needed to deliver your message to the audience.\r\n\r\nIt can also be distracting for your audience if your eyes are not focused on the camera and you are clearly reading line for line.\r\n\r\nA better approach is to learn your content well and rely on notes that contain key words.

On this page, you'll find some of the terminology you'll need to get started, along with explanations and examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContention\r\nA contention is the main point of view or opinion the writer is wanting to convey to the reader, usually supported by the claims.\r\nAn author's contention is the main claim they're trying to prove throughout their article.\r\n\r\n \tPlacing their contention at the beginning is the most direct method, and has the effect of positioning the reader to the author's beliefs from the outset.\r\n \tA contention placed at the end of an article can have the effect of seeming like a valid, logical conclusion to a well-thought through discussion.\r\n \tThe contention can also be repeated throughout the article. The author may have chosen to present it in this way in order to continue reiterating their main point in the audience's minds, aligning them to their views.\r\n\r\n\r\nArgument\r\nThis is a key message that a writer wants to convey to the readers to support their contention. The writer will use of range of key arguments to support their contention. The writer will use language and evidence to try to persuade you to a particular point of view.\r\n\r\nHaving determined the contention of the overall argument you are making, you will need to identify key arguments (can be called sub-arguments) to support the overall contention of the article. This argument should take a strong stance so readers understand exactly what your claim is.\r\n\r\n\r\nClaims\r\nThese are the key points of the argument. Each key argument should have a central claim. This is often presented as the topic sentence for the key argument.\r\nA Claim is a statement asserted within the argument that can be assessed to be true or false.\r\n\r\n \tEach claim can be supported by a number of sub claims, arguments or evidence.\r\n \tThe claim may contain additional contextual material, for example explaining terms used and scope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence\r\nEvidence is information that an author weaves into the writing in order to substantiate claims. Supports the claims and arguments and can include support for the claim, such as examples, statistics, quotes etc. In academic writing, evidence used from other sources must be referenced.\r\nEvidence is presented in support of the claim and argument. All evidence provides some level of relevance. Always analyse the quality of each piece of evidence being presented to you as the reader. You need to be able to determine the quality of evidence as being strong or weak. Also consider whether the writer adequately presents evidence that contradicts their argument. This can indicate a writer that is present a balanced perspective.\r\n\r\n \tStrong evidence: Sufficient evidence, high quality evidence.\r\n \tWeak evidence: Insufficient evidence, poor quality evidence.\r\n\r\nA contention needs to be supported by relevant, reliable, credible, sufficient and current evidence.\r\n\r\nIf there is no evidence, it isn't an argument - it is only an opinion, a description, or an explanation.\r\n\r\nQuestion the evidence the author has used.\r\n\r\n \tDoes the evidence provided support the argument?\r\n \tHow credible (trustworthy) is the evidence?\r\n \tHas enough evidence been presented?\r\n \tDoes it come from different sources?\r\n \tAre there any missing links between the evidence and the author's contention?\r\n \tIs the evidence current?\r\n \tIs there other evidence available that might challenge the evidence used?\r\n\r\nTake notice of linking words and phrases which demonstrate cause\/reason, effect\/results, to help identify the evidence used to support the argument.\r\n\r\n\r\nAssumption\r\nAssumptions are nformation the writer believes the readers will already know. Assumptions are embedded in the arguments. They are seldom explicit and therefore can be difficult to identify.\r\nSometimes we assume the answer or reason we have given is \u2018obvious' or \u2018common sense'. This is because we believe (often incorrectly) that other people think and feel the same as we do. Assumptions come from our personal beliefs and values; they may be justified, or not. Often assumptions are also unstated or \u2018hidden' because the writer feels it is unnecessary to explain.\r\n\r\nWeak or false arguments are based on incorrect assumptions and are not well-supported by credible evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersuasive language\r\nUsing persuasive language is a deliberate choice of words which are intended to influence or to trigger a response.\r\nThis refers to a range of different persuasive language techniques used by writers in their texts to trigger a particular effect on the reader.\r\n\r\nPersuasive language includes:\r\n\r\nRidicule, attacks: The writer attacks an opponent or idea. This is an assertion of the writer's viewpoint, and is used to prove the writers point by using attacking and putting down persuasion techniques against the opponent or idea. These methods are often effective in placing the reader in a position of agreement with the writer.\r\n\r\nEmotional language:: Words used to deliberately create an emotional impact or response from the audience. The effect of using emotive language as a persuasive technique is to appeal to people's emotions and trigger an emotional response.\r\n\r\nHyperbole: A hyperbole is an extreme exaggeration used to make a point for emphasis. They are not meant to be taken literally. By using a hyperbole, a story can quickly become interesting or sound more convincing. Hyperboles are comparisons, but are exaggerated and often ridiculous.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Let's unpack some of the key terms involved in argument analysis.

These structures are used to show how the electrons are arranged around individual atoms in a molecule. The main purpose of Lewis structures is to predict the number and type of bonds that may form around an atom.\r\n\r\nWorked example \u2013 drawing Lewis structures of molecular compounds\r\nDraw the Lewis structure of sulfur dioxide, \\(\\ce{SO}_{2}\\).\r\nStep 1: Count the total number of valence shell electrons of all the atoms involved in the molecule.\r\nSulfur dioxide has two sulfur atoms and one oxygen atom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAtom\r\nAtomic number\r\nElectron configuration\r\nValence shell electrons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{S}\\)\r\n\\(16\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}\\,3p^{4}\\)\r\n\\(6\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{O}\\)\r\n\\(8\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{4}\\)\r\n\\(6\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total number of valence shell electrons is:\r\n\\[6+\\left(6\\times2\\right)=18\\]\r\n\r\nStep 2: Predict the central atom. This is the atom that can form most bonds. If two different atoms can form the same number of bonds, then the least electronegative atom should be the central atom.\r\nAmong sulfur and oxygen, sulfur is the least electronegative atom. Therefore, it is the central atom.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Draw single bonds connected to the central atom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 4: Add the lone pairs of electrons to the atoms connected to the central atom.

Water (\\(\\ce{H2O}\\)) is essential for life, carbon dioxide (\\(\\ce{CO2}\\)) is a key component of the Earth's atmosphere, and methane (\\(\\ce{CH4}\\)) is a common fuel source. Use this resource to learn more about how covalent bonds form.\r\n\r\nFormation of molecular compounds\r\nCovalent bonding primarily occurs between non-metal atoms or elements located in the \\(p\\)-block. Whereas ionic bonding involves the transfer of valence electrons, covalent bonding involves the sharing of valence shell electrons to achieve a complete outer shell. Atoms held together by covalent bonds are called molecular compounds. The figure below shows the formation of three covalent molecular compounds: \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\), \\(\\ce{F}_{2}\\) and \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tHydrogen gas, \\(\\ce{H2}\\), is formed when two hydrogen atoms share one electron in their valence electron shell (\\(1s\\)) with each other. This allows each hydrogen atom to achieve a full electron shell with the electron configuration of a noble gas, \\(\\ce{He}\\): \\(1s^{2}\\)\r\n\tFluorine gas, \\(\\ce{F2}\\), is formed when two fluorine atoms share a pair of electrons in their valence electron shell (\\(2p\\)). This allows each fluorine atom to achieve a full electron shell with the electron configuration of a noble gas, \\(\\ce{Ne}\\): \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\)\r\n\tWater, \\(\\ce{H2O}\\), is formed when two hydrogen atoms share one electron in their valence electron shell (\\(1s\\)) with an oxygen atom. The oxygen atom shares one electron in their valence electron shell (\\(2p\\)) with each hydrogen atom. This allows each hydrogen atom to achieve a full electron shell with the electron configuration of a noble gas, \\(\\ce{He}\\): \\(1s^{2}\\). It also allows the oxygen atom to achieve a full electron shell with the electron configuration of a noble gas, \\(\\ce{Ne}\\): \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber of covalent bonds\r\nGenerally, the number of covalent bonds an atom forms depends on how many electrons an atom requires to achieve an octet. For instance, \\(\\ce{C}\\) forms four covalent bonds as \\(\\ce{C}\\) \\(\\left(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{2}\\right)\\) needs four more electrons to acquire an octet in their valence shell. A few more examples are listed in the table.\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nElement\r\nElectron configuration\r\nElectrons required to fill the octet\r\nNumber of covalent bonds\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{N}\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{3}\\)\r\n\\(3\\)\r\n\\(3\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{O}\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{4}\\)\r\n\\(2\\)\r\n\\(2\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{F}\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{5}\\)\r\n\\(1\\)\r\n\\(1\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{H}\\)\r\n\\(1s^{1}\\)\r\n\\(1\\)\r\n\\(1\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the number of covalent bonds formed by an atom is not always guided by the octet rule. Let's take \\(\\ce{S}\\) as an example. \\(\\ce{S}\\) can form four or six covalent bonds, such as \\(\\ce{SF}_{4}\\) and \\(\\ce{SF}_{6}\\). Some other exceptions to the octet rule are \\(\\ce{BF}_{3}\\), \\(\\ce{PCl}_{5}\\) and some of the \\(p\\) block elements in period \\(4\\), as they have empty \\(d\\) orbitals.\r\n\r\n\r\nTypes of covalent bonds\r\nWhen two electrons are shared between two atoms, a single bond forms. \r\nMultiple covalent bonds are formed between two atoms when they share more than one pair of electrons to acquire valence shell octet. For instance, \\(\\ce{CO}_{2}\\): \\(\\ce{C}\\) forms two covalent bonds (two pairs of electrons or four electrons) with each oxygen atom involved. These are called double bonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same way, when six electrons are shared between two atoms, a triple bond forms. Ethyne is an example of a molecular compound that forms a triple bond. One carbon atom shares six electrons with another carbon atom to complete the octet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCoordinate covalent bonds\r\nTypically, each atom contributes one or more electrons to the covalent bond. When the electrons shared between two atoms are donated by only one atom, the resulting bond is known as a coordinate covalent bond. In a coordinate covalent bond, an atom with a filled orbital shares its two electrons with an empty orbital of another atom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples of molecular compounds with coordinate covalent bonds are carbon monoxide (\\(\\ce{CO}\\)) and ozone (\\(\\ce{O3}\\)). \r\n\r\nThe shape of molecular compounds\r\nThe three-dimensional arrangement of a molecular compound gives it a molecular shape. Shape is primarily determined by valence shell electron repulsion (VSEPR) theory. Being able to draw Lewis structures also helps with determining molecular shape.\r\n\r\nValence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory\r\nVSEPR theory states that the shape of a molecule is determined by the number of electron clouds around the central atom. Non-bonding (lone pair) and bonding valence electrons are considered electron clouds. Due to the repulsion forces between electron clouds, they attempt to stay as far as possible. \r\nFor instance, a carbon dioxide molecule has two electron clouds (two \\(\\ce{C}-\\ce{O}\\) bonds) around the central atom \\(\\ce{C}\\). As a result of repulsion forces between these two electron clouds, the molecule is arranged into linear geometry with a bond angle of \\(180^{\\circ}\\). Multiple bonds, such as double and triple bonds, are considered one electron cloud.\r\nDepending on the number of electron clouds around a central atom, the number of bonds formed and the number of lone pairs, the molecular shape will vary. The different molecular shapes are summarised in the table below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber of bonds\r\nNumber of lone pairs\r\nTotal number of electron clouds\r\nShape\r\nExample\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n0\r\n2\r\nLinear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n1\r\n3\r\nAngular\/bent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n2\r\n4\r\nAngular\/bent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n0\r\n3\r\nTrigonal planar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n1\r\n4\r\nPyramidal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n0\r\n4\r\nTetrahedal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen more than one central atom is present in the molecule, the molecular geometry of each central atom is predicted and the results are combined. For example, \\(\\ce{C}_{2}\\ce{H}_{4}\\) has two central \\(\\ce{C}\\) atoms. Each \\(\\ce{C}\\) atom is attached to three electron clouds. This means each \\(\\ce{C}\\) atom has a trigonal planar geometry. In this case, the whole molecule is also planar, as the bond angles \\(\\ce{H}-\\ce{C}-\\ce{H}\\) and \\(\\ce{H}-\\ce{C}-\\ce{C}\\) are \\(120^{\\circ}\\) each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe polarity of molecular compounds\r\nIn chemistry, polarity refers to the distribution of electric charge around atoms or molecules. The concept of polarity is crucial in understanding how covalent bonds and entire molecules interact with each other, influencing their physical and chemical properties.\r\n\r\nBond polarity\r\nIn the context of covalent bonds, polarity arises when there is an unequal sharing of electrons between atoms due to differences in their electronegativities. This results in one end of the bond having a partial negative charge (designated \\(\\delta-\\)) and the other a partial positive charge (designated \\(\\delta+\\)). The partially negative end is electron-rich, while the partially positive end is electron-poor. This creates something called a dipole moment.\r\nA covalent bond in which this occurs is called a polar covalent bond. One example is \\(\\ce{HF}\\). The electronegativity (EN) of the \\(\\ce{H}\\) atom is \\(2.20\\). The EN of the \\(\\ce{F}\\) atom is \\(3.98\\). The difference in EN is \\(3.98-2.20=1.78\\). Valence electrons shared by \\(\\ce{H}\\) and \\(\\ce{F}\\) are more attracted to the electronegative \\(\\ce{F}\\) atom. The \\(\\ce{F}\\) atom therefore has a partial negative charge and is labelled \\(\\delta-\\), and the \\(\\ce{H}\\) atom has a partial positive charge and is labelled \\(\\delta+\\).\r\nA bond in which electrons are shared equally is simply called a non-polar covalent bond. An example is the bond between the two \\(\\ce{H}\\) atoms that make \\(\\ce{H2}\\). The difference in EN is \\(0\\).\r\nThe difference between the EN of participating atoms in a bond also indicates whether the bond is ionic, non-polar covalent or polar covalent. Compared to ionic bonds, the difference between the EN of atoms participating in covalent bonding is much smaller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElectronegativity difference\r\nType of bond\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\geqslant2.0\\)\r\nIonic\r\n\\(\\ce{NaCl}\\), \\(\\ce{CsF}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(0.5-1.9\\)\r\nPolar covalent\r\n\\(\\ce{HCl}\\), \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{O}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(0-0.4\\)\r\nCovalent\r\n\\(\\ce{CH}_{4}\\), \\(\\ce{O}_{2}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMolecular polarity\r\nWhen discussing molecules, polarity depends on the polarity of the individual bonds, the contribution from lone pair electrons, and the molecular shape. In a polar molecule, electrons are more strongly attracted to one end of the molecule. For example, in the \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) molecule, due to the high EN of the \\(\\ce{O}\\) atom, electrons are strongly attracted to the \\(\\ce{O}\\) atom. This creates a net polarity point between two \\(\\ce{O}-\\ce{H}\\) bonds. The polarity of the molecule is indicated using a crossed arrow that points in the direction of electron attraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some cases, although the individual covalent bonds are polar, overall the molecule becomes non-polar due to the shape of the molecule. For instance, a carbon dioxide molecule has polar \\(\\ce{C}-\\ce{O}\\) bonds. However, due to the linear symmetrical shape of the molecule, polar bonds (dipoles) cancel each other, creating a zero net polarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNaming molecular compounds\r\nTo name molecular compounds, you can follow the steps below. Let's use \\(\\ce{CCl4}\\) as an example.\r\n\r\n \tName the less electronegative atom first. Non-metals located on the left side of the periodic table are written before non-metals located on the right side. For \\(\\ce{CCl4}\\), carbon is less electronegative than the chlorine, so \"carbon\" is written first.\r\n \tName the more electronegative atom with the suffix \"\u2013ide\", as used for anions. For \\(\\ce{CCl4}\\), this would be \"chloride\".\r\n \tIdentify the number of atoms of each element involved in the compound and use the prefixes di\u2013, tri\u2013, tetra\u2013, penta\u2013, etc, to show how many of each atom is present. No prefix is used if there is only one atom of the element. \\(\\ce{CCl4}\\) has one carabon atom and four chlorine atoms, so is named \"carbon tetrachloride\".\r\n\r\nSome other examples are \"carbon monoxide\" for \\(\\ce{CO}\\), \"carbon dioxide\" for \\(\\ce{CO2}\\), \"boron trichloride\" for \\(\\ce{BCl3}\\) and \"dinitrogen pentoxide\" for \\(\\ce{N2O5}\\). \r\nCovalent bonding diagrams\r\n\r\n    \r\n        Hydrogen molecule (H2)\r\n        \r\n            Two hydrogen atoms (H), each with 1s electron, combine to form an H2 molecule with a shared electron pair.\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Fluorine molecule (F2)\r\n        \r\n            Two fluorine atoms (F), each with 2p electrons, combine to form an F2 molecule with a shared electron pair.\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Water molecule (H2O)\r\n        \r\n            Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom combine.

Improve your knowledge of stoichiometry by using this resource to learn about the stoichiometric coefficient, the molar ratio and chemical equations.\r\nStoichiometry describes the quantitative relationship between relative quantities of reactants and products in a balanced chemical equation. Stoichiometric coefficients are the numbers written immediately before the atoms, ions and molecules in a balanced chemical equation. These numbers indicate the ratio of any reactant or product that reacts or forms in a reaction.\r\nAs an example, let's consider the reaction between hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas to form ammonia. The balanced chemical equation can be written as:\r\n\\[3\\ce{H}_{2}\\left(\\textrm{g}\\right)+\\ce{N}_{2}\\left(\\textrm{g}\\right)\\rightarrow2\\ce{NH}_{3}\\left(\\textrm{g}\\right)\\]\r\nThe numbers three, one and two are written in front of \\(\\ce{H}\\), \\(\\ce{N}\\) and \\(\\ce{NH}_{3}\\), respectively. These are the stoichiometric coefficients. They show that three molecules of hydrogen gas react with one molecule of nitrogen gas to form two ammonia molecules. When there is no coefficient before an atom, ion or molecule, we interpret it as one. For example, the coefficient of molecular nitrogen in this reaction is one.\r\n\r\nMolar ratios\r\nThe stoichiometric coefficients in a balanced chemical equation can also be interpreted on the molar scale. Molar scale interpretation relates to the quantities of substances involved in the reaction. Therefore, if we know the amount of one substance involved in the reaction, we can use the molar ratio to determine the amounts of others involved in the reaction. Let's consider the same example:\r\n\\[3\\ce{H}_{2}\\left(\\textrm{g}\\right)+\\ce{N}_{2}\\left(\\textrm{g}\\right)\\rightarrow2\\ce{NH}_{3}\\left(\\textrm{g}\\right)\\]\r\nUsing the molar scale, we can say that three moles of hydrogen gas react with one mole of nitrogen gas to form two moles of ammonia gas.\r\n\r\nLimiting and excess reactants\r\nIn chemical reactions, limiting and excess reactants (or reagents) determine the extent of the reaction and the amount of products formed. The limiting reactant is the substance that is consumed completely first, thus limiting the amount of product that can be formed. Once the limiting reactant is used up, the reaction cannot proceed further, even if other reactants are still available. On the other hand, excess reactants are those that remain after the reaction has reached completion.\r\nLet's consider the reaction between hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas to form ammonia gas again: \r\n\\[3\\ce{H}_{2}\\left(\\textrm{g}\\right)+\\ce{N}_{2}\\left(\\textrm{g}\\right)\\rightarrow2\\ce{NH}_{3}\\left(\\textrm{g}\\right)\\]\r\nBased on stoichiometry, we know that if we mix three moles of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) with one mole of \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\), we can obtain two moles of \\(\\ce{NH}_{3}\\). In other words, \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) reacts with \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\) in a molar ratio of \\(3:1\\).\r\nIf we mix three moles of hydrogen gas and two moles of nitrogen gas, two moles of \\(\\ce{NH}_{3}\\) will be produced. However, the entire quantity of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) will be used before the \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\) as we start with the exact amount of \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) required for the reaction. The product mixture will contain one unreacted mole of \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\) as we only required one mole of \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\) for the reaction. If we had more \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\), we could have produced more \\(\\ce{NH}_{3}\\) as we already have excess \\(\\ce{N}_{2}\\). Therefore, in this reaction, we call \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\) the limiting reagent since it limits the production of \\(\\ce{NH}_{3}\\).\r\nHence, the limiting reagent is the reactant that runs out first, limiting the formation of products. Nitrogen gas is called the excess reagent because we have a greater amount than required for the reaction.\r\n\r\nReaction yield\r\nThe theoretical yield is the maximum amount of product that can form under the given reaction conditions. This is determined by the amount of limiting reagent available. Theoretical yield can be calculated using the stoichiometric coefficients (or molar ratios) in the balanced chemical equation. We calculate theoretical yield assuming no losses occur during the reaction, and all the reactants are converted into products. However, in reality, losses and inefficiencies occur during chemical reactions. Therefore, the actual amount you isolate and measure from a chemical reaction is less than what you expect in theory.\r\nThe actual yield of a reaction is the amount of the product you isolate from the chemical reaction. Actual yield must be determined experimentally, so it often referred to as experimental yield. You need to isolate the product and weigh it to get the actual yield.\r\nThe percentage yield indicates how efficient the reaction was in converting reactants into products. If the value is closer to \\(100\\textrm{%}\\), most of the reactants were converted into products; the reaction was closer to completion. Percentage yield can be calculated using:\r\n\\[\\textrm{Percentage yield}=\\frac{\\textrm{Actual yield}}{\\textrm{Theoretical yield}}\\times100\\textrm{%}\\]\r\n\r\nWorked example \u2013 calculating the amount of product formed from a chemical reaction\r\nCalculate the amount in moles of ammonia gas that can be produced from \\(0.18\\textrm{ mol}\\) of hydrogen gas. \\[3\\ce{H}_{2}\\left(\\textrm{g}\\right)+\\ce{N}_{2}\\left(\\textrm{g}\\right)\\rightarrow2\\ce{NH}_{3}\\left(\\textrm{g}\\right)\\]\r\nStep 1: Determine the molar ratio of the compounds and write it as a fraction.

Keep reading to learn more.\r\n\r\nOxidation and reduction\r\nRedox reactions involve the net movement of electrons from one reactant to the other. This causes some reactants to gain electrons (reduction), while others lose electrons (oxidation). An easy way to remember which is which is by using the acronym OIL RIG:\r\n\r\n \tOxidation is the loss of electron(s) by an atom or ion.\r\n \tReduction is the gain of electron(s) by an atom or ion.\r\n\r\nRedox reactions can be described using full redox equations, such as:\r\n\r\n\\[ \\ce{CuO}(\\textrm{s})+\\ce{H2}(\\textrm{g})\\rightarrow\\ce{Cu}(\\textrm{s})+\\ce{H2O}(\\textrm{g}) \\]\r\n\r\nThis can be broken into half-equations (sometimes called \"half-reactions\"). Half-equations show the loss of electrons (oxidation) or gain of electrons (reduction):\r\n\r\n \tThe reduction half-equation shows \\(\\ce{Cu}^{2+}\\) being reduced: \\(\\ce{Cu}^{2+}+2e\\rightarrow\\ce{Cu}\\). In this half-equation, the redox couple is \\(\\ce{Cu}^{2+}\\)\/\\(\\ce{Cu}\\).\r\n \tThe oxidation half-equation shows \\(\\ce{H2}\\) being oxidised: \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\rightarrow2\\ce{H}^{+}+2e\\). In this half-equation, the redox couple is \\(\\ce{H2}\\)\/\\(\\ce{H}^{+}\\).\r\n\r\nAnother example is the full redox equation: \\(2\\ce{Ag}^{+}+\\ce{Zn}\\rightarrow2\\ce{Ag}+\\ce{Zn}^{2+} \\)\r\n\r\n \tThe reduction half-equation shows \\(\\ce{Ag}^{+}\\) being reduced: \\(2\\ce{Ag}^{+}+2e\\rightarrow2\\ce{Ag}\\). The redox couple is \\(\\ce{Ag}^{+}\\)\/\\(\\ce{Ag}\\).\r\n \tThe oxidation half-equation shows \\(\\ce{Zn}\\) being oxidised: \\(\\ce{Zn}\\rightarrow\\ce{Zn}^{2+}+2e\\). The redox couple is \\(\\ce{Zn}\\)\/\\(\\ce{Zn}^{2+}\\).\r\n\r\nRedox equations are usually written as balanced net ionic equations. These equations exclude spectator ions (ions that do not take part in the overall redox process).\r\n\r\nOxidising agents and reducing agents\r\nOxidising agents (or oxidants) can become reduced (gains electrons) while causing another reactant to become oxidised (lose electrons). Reducing agents (or reductants) reduce another reactant by offering electrons to the other reactant. Thus, the reducing agent becomes oxidised (by losing electrons) while reducing another reactant (causing it to gain electrons).\r\nOxidation number\r\nThe oxidation number is the apparent electrical charge on the atom. It helps you keep track of the electrons during a reaction.\r\n\r\n \tWhen a chemical species is oxidised, its oxidation number increases.\r\n \tWhen a chemical species is reduced, its oxidation number decreases.\r\n\r\nYou can assign an oxidation number to any element in a given compound using the rules in the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRule\r\nExample\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The oxidation number of an atom as an element is zero.\r\nThe \\(\\ce{O}\\) in \\(\\ce{O2}\\) has an oxidation number of \\(0\\). The oxidation numbers of \\(\\ce{N}\\) and \\(\\ce{Br}\\) are \\(0\\) in \\(\\ce{N2}\\) and \\(\\ce{Br2}\\), respectively. The oxidation number of \\(\\ce{Fe}\\) in \\(\\ce{Fe}\\) metal is also \\(0\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The oxidation number of \\(\\ce{O}\\) is usually \\(-2\\), except when it is bonded to \\(\\ce{F}\\) or in a peroxide (like \\(\\ce{H2O2}\\)).\r\nThe \\(\\ce{O}\\) in \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) has an oxidation number of \\(-2\\). In \\(\\ce{OF2}\\), \\(\\ce{O}\\) has an oxidation number of \\(+2\\). In \\(\\ce{H2O2}\\), it is \\(-1\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The oxidation number of a monoatomic ion is equal to the ion's charge.\r\nThe oxidation number of \\(\\ce{Na}^{+}\\) is \\(+1\\). The oxidation number of \\(\\ce{Cl}^{-}\\) is \\(-1\\). The oxidation number of \\(\\ce{S}^{2-}\\) is \\(-2\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The algebraic sum of the oxidation numbers in a neutral polyatomic compound is zero.\r\n\\(\\ce{NaCl}\\) has an oxidation number of \\(0\\). The oxidation numbers of \\(\\ce{Na}\\) and \\(\\ce{Cl}\\) are \\(+1\\) and \\(-1\\), respectively. \\(+1-1=0\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n5. In a polyatomic ion, the sum of the oxidation numbers is equal to the ion's overall charge.\r\n\\(\\ce{CO}_{3}^{2-}\\) has an overall charge of \\(-2\\). The oxidation numbers of its constituent atoms are \\((+4)+(-2)+(-2)+(-2)=-2\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n6. In a compound containing multiple elements, the more electronegative element has its characteristic negative oxidation number and the less electronegative element has a positive oxidation number.\r\n\\(\\ce{N}\\) has an oxidation number of \\(-3\\), \\(\\ce{O}\\) has an oxidation number of \\(-2\\) and \\(\\ce{Cl}\\) has an oxidation number of \\(-1\\). \\(\\ce{H}\\), \\(\\ce{Ca}\\) and \\(\\ce{Al}\\) have the oxidation numbers of \\(+1\\), \\(+2\\) and \\(+3\\), respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. The oxidation number of \\(\\ce{H}\\) is usually \\(+1\\) because it is less electronegative than that of the main group elements to which it is normally bonded. With more electropositive elements, \\(\\ce{H}\\) has an oxidation number of \\(-1\\).\r\nIn \\(\\ce{HCl}\\), \\(\\ce{H}\\) has an oxidation number of \\(+1\\). However, in \\(\\ce{NaH}\\), it has an oxidation number of \\(-1\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard reduction potential\r\nRedox reactions involve the movement of electrons, so there is also a voltage associated with it. This is called the standard reduction potential, \\(E^{0}\\). It is the tendency for a reactant to attract electrons, cause oxidation, and be reduced itself. It is measured in volts (\\(\\textrm{V}\\)) and is defined for an oxidising agent at a concentration of \\(1\\textrm{M}\\) for solutions, \\(1\\textrm{ atm}\\) pressure for gases, and \\(25\u00baC\\) temperature.\r\n\r\nThe greater (more positive) the value of \\(E^{0}\\), the greater the tendency for the oxidising agent to spontaneously become reduced itself and cause another reactant to undergo oxidation. It will remove electrons from a redox couple with a less positive \\(E^{0}\\). Thus, there would be a spontaneous redox reaction.\r\nWorked example \u2013 determining oxidation numbers\r\nFind the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{S}\\) in \\(\\ce{H2SO4}(\\textrm{aq})\\).\r\n\r\nStep 1: Identify the relevant oxidation number rule\/s.\r\n\r\nRule 4 states that the algebraic sum of the oxidation numbers in a neutral polyatomic compound is zero, so:\r\n\r\n\\[(2\\times\\ce{H})+\\ce{S}+(4\\times\\ce{O})=0\\]\r\n\r\nRule \\(2\\) states that the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{O}\\) is \\(-2\\) and rule \\(6\\) states the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{H}\\) is \\(+1\\).\r\n\r\nStep 2: Use algebra to calculate the missing oxidation number.\r\n\r\nLet the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{S}=x\\).\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} (2\\times\\left(+1\\right))+x+(4\\times\\left(-2\\right)) &amp; =0\\\\\r\n2+x-8 &amp; =0\\\\\r\nx-6 &amp; =0\\\\\r\nx &amp; =+6\r\n\\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nTherefore, the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{S}\\) in \\(\\ce{H2SO4}\\) is \\(+6\\).\r\n\r\n\r\nWorked example \u2013 predicting the products of redox reactions\r\nPredict the products formed from the spontaneous redox reaction between the two redox couples: \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\/\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\) and \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\/\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\), given the data below.\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\nRedox couple\r\n\\(E^{0}\\) (\\(\\textrm{V}\\))\r\n\\(e^{-}\\) donor\/acceptor?\r\nOxidising or reducing agent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\/\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\)\r\n\\(+1.51\\)\r\n\\(e^{-}\\) acceptor\r\nOxidising agent\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\/\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\\)\r\n\\(+0.17\\)\r\n\\(e^{-}\\) donor\r\nReducing agent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 1: Identify the redox couple with the greater\/more positive \\(E^{0}\\).\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\/\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\) has a \\(E^{0}\\) of \\(+1.51\\textrm{ V}\\).\r\n\r\nStep 2: Identify the oxidising agent in this couple. The oxidising agent becomes reduced itself, so its oxidation number decreases.\r\n\r\nWe can use the worked example above to find the oxidation numbers of each atom in the redox pair.\r\n\r\nIn \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\), the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{Mn}\\) is \\(+7\\) and the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{O}\\) is \\(-2\\). In \\(\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\), the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\) is \\(+2\\).\r\n\r\nThe oxidising agent becomes reduced, so it is the species that contains the atom with the higher oxidation number. Here, it would be \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\). It has the greater affinity (liking) for electrons. Therefore, \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\) will be the electron acceptor (i.e. oxidising agent).\r\n\r\nStep 3: Identify the reducing agent in the other couple. The reducing agent becomes oxidised itself, so its oxidation number increases.\r\n\r\nThe sulfur system must donate electrons; hence, \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\\) will be the electron donor (i.e. reducing agent). We can check the oxidation numbers to confirm this.\r\n\r\nIn \\(\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\), the oxidation numbers of \\(\\ce{S}\\) and \\(\\ce{O}\\) are \\(+6\\) and \\(-2\\), respectively. In \\(\\ce{H2SO3}\\), the oxidation numbers of \\(\\ce{H}\\), \\(\\ce{S}\\) and \\(\\ce{O}\\) are \\(+1\\), \\(+4\\), and \\(-2\\), respectively.\r\n\r\nThe reducing agent would contain the atom with the lower oxidation number, i.e. \\(\\ce{H2SO3}\\).\r\n\r\nStep 4: Write the half-equations for the redox reaction.\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\) is reduced to \\(\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\), so the reduction half-equation is:\r\n\r\n\\[\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\rightarrow\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\]\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{H2SO3}\\) is oxidised to \\(\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\), so the oxidation half-equation is:\r\n\r\n\\[\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\\rightarrow\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\]\r\nWorked example \u2013 writing balanced half-equations for redox equations\r\nBalance the following full redox equation for the reaction occurring between the reactants in the previous example:\r\n\\[\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}+\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\rightarrow\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}+\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\]\r\n\r\nStep 1: Assign oxidation numbers to each element in the equation to determine which reactants are being oxidised and reduced.\r\n\r\nThe oxidation number of \\(\\ce{Mn}\\) in \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\) is \\(+7\\) and the \\(\\ce{Mn}\\) oxidation number in \\(\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\) is \\(+2\\). Thus, \\(\\ce{Mn}^{7+}\\)is being reduced to \\(\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\).\r\n\r\nThe oxidation number of \\(\\ce{S}\\) in \\(\\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\\) is \\(+4\\), and the oxidation number of \\(\\ce{S}\\) in \\(\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\) ion is \\(+6\\). So, \\(\\ce{S}\\) is being oxidised to \\(\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\).\r\n\r\nStep 2: Divide the equation into the appropriate half-reactions which can be balanced separately.\r\n\r\nThe reduction half-reaction is: \\(\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\rightarrow\\ce{Mn}^{2+}\\)\r\n\r\nThe oxidation half-reaction is: \\[ \\ce{H}_{2}\\ce{SO}_{3}\\rightarrow\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\]\r\n\r\nStep 3: Write separate balanced chemical equations for reduction and oxidation. Use the acronym KOHES:\r\n\r\n \tKey elements (elements aside from oxygen and hydrogen)\r\n \tOxygen \u2013 add water molecules to balance the oxygen atoms\r\n \tHydrogen \u2013 add hydrogen ions (\\(\\ce{H}^{+}\\)) to balance the hydrogen atoms\r\n \tElectrons \u2013 add electrons (\\(e^{-}\\)) to balance the charges\r\n \tStates \u2013 add states for all species except electrons, which have no state\r\n\r\nStarting with the reduction half-equation, the key elements are already balanced as there is \\(1\\textrm{ Mg}\\) on either side of the reaction arrow. There are \\(4\\textrm{ O}\\) atoms on the reactant side and none on the product side, so to balance the \\(\\textrm{ O}\\) atoms, we need to add \\(4\\textrm{ H}_{2}\\textrm{O}\\) to the product side.\r\n\r\n\\[\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}\\rightarrow\\ce{Mn}^{2+}+4\\ce{H2O}\\]\r\n\r\nNext, we need to balance the \\(\\textrm{H}\\) by adding \\(8\\textrm{ H}^{+}\\) ions to the reactant side. This will give us \\(8\\textrm{ H}\\) atoms on each side.\r\n\r\n\\[\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}+8\\ce{H}^{+}\\rightarrow\\ce{Mn}^{2+}+4\\ce{H2O}\\]\r\n\r\nTo balance the charge, add \\(e^{-}\\). On the reactant side, the charge is \\((-1)+(+8)=(+7)\\) and on the product side, the charge is \\(+2\\). We need to add \\(5e^{-}\\) to the reactant side to make the charge \\(+2\\) on both sides.\r\n\r\n\\[\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}+8\\ce{H}^{+}+5e^{-}\\rightarrow\\ce{Mn}^{2+}+4\\ce{H2O}\\]\r\n\r\nFinally, we can add states.\r\n\r\n\\[\\ce{MnO}_{4}^{-}(\\textrm{aq})+8\\ce{H}^{+}(\\textrm{aq})+5e^{-}\\rightarrow\\ce{Mn}^{2+}(\\textrm{aq})+4\\ce{H2O}(\\textrm{l})\\]\r\n\r\nWe can confirm that this is a reduction half-equation by looking at which side of the arrow the electrons are on. For reduction half-equations, the electrons are always on the reactant (left-hand) side. This is indeed the case.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Repeat step 3 for the oxidation half-equation.\r\n\r\nThere is one key element, \\(\\ce{S}\\), and it is already balanced, so we can move on to \\(ce{O}\\). There are \\(3\\textrm{ O}\\) atoms on the reactant side and \\(4\\textrm{ O}\\) atoms on the product side. We need to add \\(1\\textrm{ H}_{2}\\textrm{O}\\) to the reactant side.\r\n\r\n\\[\\ce{H2SO3}+\\ce{H2O}\\rightarrow\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\]\r\n\r\nTo balance the \\(\\ce{H}\\) atoms, we add \\(4\\textrm{ H}^{+}\\) to the product side.\r\n\r\n\\[\\ce{H2SO3}+\\ce{H2O}\\rightarrow\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}+4\\ce{H}^{+}\\]\r\n\r\nTo balance the charge, we add \\(2e^{-}\\) to the product side.\r\n\r\n\\[\\ce{H2SO3}+\\ce{H2O}\\rightarrow\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}+4\\ce{H}^{+}+2e^{-}\\]\r\n\r\nAnd finally, states.\r\n\r\n\\[\\ce{H2SO3}(\\textrm{aq})+\\ce{H2O}(\\textrm{l})\\rightarrow\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}(\\textrm{aq})+4\\ce{H}^{+}(\\textrm{aq})+2e^{-}\\]\r\n\r\nWe can confirm that this is an oxidation question as the electrons are on the product (right-hand) side.\r\n\r\nStep 5: To get the full equation, the electrons need to be eliminated.

It dictates how substances dissolve and interact, impacting fields like pharmaceuticals, environmental science, cooking, and chemical reactions. Understanding solubility allows for better control and optimisation of processes in these areas.\r\n\r\nSolutes, solvents and solutions\r\nA solute is a substance that is dissolved to form a solution. A solvent is the substance that the solute dissolves in. Solutions are therefore the resulting mixture. The formation of a mixture involves attractive intermolecular forces between solutes and solvent molecules, which allow them to mix together.\r\nIn a solution, the solvent can be liquid water or something else such as alcohol-based solvents, acetone and ethyl ether. When liquid water is the solvent, the solution is an aqueous solution. If the solvent is not liquid water, we call it a non-aqueous solution.\r\nTo prepare a solution, a known mass of solute (e.g. \\(5.85\\textrm{ g}\\) of \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\)) is dissolved in a solvent, like water, to give a known volume of solution (e.g. \\(250.0\\textrm{ mL}\\) aqueous solution). If the solid solute readily dissolves in the solvent, it is soluble. If it does not readily dissolve and remains as a solid, it is considered insoluble.\r\n\r\nSaturation\r\nThe level of saturation describes the extent to which a solution contains dissolved solute relative to its maximum solubility at a given temperature and pressure. There are three ways to classify the level of saturation:\r\n\r\n\tUnsaturated solutions contain less than the maximum amount of solute that can be dissolved under given conditions.\r\n\tSaturated solutions contain the maximum amount of solute that can be dissolved under the given conditions.\r\n\tSupersaturated solutions contain more dissolved solute molecules than a saturated solution. They exist in an unstable, temporary condition. A supersaturated solution always tries to revert to a saturated state with time, through the formation of crystals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solubility rule\r\nThe solubility of a solute depends on whether it can form attractive forces with the solvent molecules, which in turn, depends on the types of forces it can form.\r\n\r\n\tPolar solutes dissolve in polar solvents. Polar substances can interact via electrostatic forces, due to the presence of partial or complete charges.\r\n\tNon-polar solutes dissolve in non-polar solvents. Non-polar substances are unlikely to form electrostatic forces. Instead, they interact with each other via dispersion forces.\r\n\r\nThus, when you are predicting the solubility of a solute in a solvent, you should check whether the solute is an ionic or molecular compound, and whether the solvent liquid contains polar or non-polar molecules. This concept is summarised by the solubility rule:\r\n\"Like dissolves like.\"\r\n\r\nFactors affecting solubility\r\nAs well as the polarity of the solute and solvent, there are other external factors that affect solubility. One key example is temperature. Many solids show increased solubility in water at higher temperatures. In contrast, gases generally have a lower solubility in water with increased temperature.\r\n\r\nWorked example \u2013 predicting solubility\r\nCompare the solubility of hexane and glucose in water.\r\nStep 1: Determine whether the solutes are polar or non-polar.\r\nHexane, \\(\\ce{C6H14}\\), is a non-polar solute. Glucose, \\(\\ce{C6H12O6}\\), is a polar solute due to the presence of hydroxyl (\\(\\ce{OH}\\)) groups.\r\nStep 2: Determine whether the solvent is polar or non-polar.\r\nWater, \\(\\ce{H2O}\\), is polar.\r\nStep 3: Recall the solubility rule and apply it to the solutes and solvent in the question.\r\n\"Like dissolves like\", therefore the polar water solvent will only dissolve polar solutes. This means that hexane is not soluble in water, but glucose is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Solubility is the measure of how well a solute can dissolve in a solvent to form a solution.

Understanding these principles is key to navigating and manipulating the mixtures that we encounter in our daily routines.\r\n\r\nExpressing concentrations\r\nConcentration (\\(c\\)) refers to the amount of solute present in a given quantity (known volume) of a solution. It is common to encounter concentration of a solute expressed using \\(c(\\textrm{chemical formula})\\) or \\(\\textrm{&#091;chemical formula&#093;}\\). For example, the concentration of \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\) can be expressed as \\(c(\\ce{NaCl}\\)) or \\(&#091;\\ce{NaCl}&#093;\\).\r\nConcentration can be represented using a range of units:\r\n\r\n \tpercent concentration (%)\r\n \tparts per million (ppm)\r\n \tparts per billion (ppb)\r\n \tmolarity (M).\r\n\r\n\r\nPercent concentration\r\nConcentration can be represented as percentage. There are three ways to do this, depending on how the solution is prepared.\r\nWhen you dissolve a mass of solute in a mass of solvent, concentration can be expressed using percentage by mass or mass\/mass, \\(\\%(\\textrm{m\/m}\\)). This is calculated using:\r\n\\[ \\frac{\\textrm{Mass of solute (g)}}{\\textrm{Mass of solution (g)}}\\times100\\% \\]\r\n When you dissolve a volume of solute in a volume of solvent, concentration can be expressed using percentage by volume or volume\/volume, \\(\\%(\\textrm{v\/v}\\)). This is calculated using:\r\n\\[ \\frac{\\textrm{Volume of solute (mL)}}{\\textrm{Volume of solution (mL)}}\\times100\\% \\]\r\nWhen you dissolve a mass of solute in a volume of solvent, concentration can be expressed using percentage mass\/volume, \\(\\%(\\textrm{m\/v}\\)). This is calculated using:\r\n\\[ \\frac{\\textrm{Mass of solute (g)}}{\\textrm{Volume of solution (mL)}}\\times100\\% \\]\r\n\r\nParts per million and parts per billion\r\nParts per million is the number of parts (mass or volume) present in one million parts (mass or volume). Similarly, parts per billion is the number of parts (mass or volume) present in one billion parts (mass or volume). For example, \\(1\\textrm{ ppm}\\) solute could indicate that \\(1\\textrm{ g}\\) of solute is present in \\(1000000\\textrm{ mL}\\) of solution. This is the same as \\(1\\textrm{ mg}\\) of solute in \\(1\\textrm{ L}\\) of solvent.\r\nConcentration in \\(\\textrm{ppm}\\) is calculated for solutes and solvents expressed in the same units using:\r\n\\[ \\frac{\\textrm{Parts of solute (g)}}{\\textrm{Parts of solvent (g)}}\\times1000000 \\]\r\nIn the same way, concentration in \\(\\textrm{ppb}\\) is calculated using:\r\n\\[ \\frac{\\textrm{Parts of solute (g)}}{\\textrm{Parts of solvent (g)}}\\times1000000000 \\]\r\n\r\nMolarity\r\nMolarity or molar concentration (\\(M\\)) is the amount of solute in moles present in one litre of a solution. It is calculated using:\r\n\\[ \\textrm{Molarity (M)}=\\frac{\\textrm{Amount of solute (mol)}}{\\textrm{Volume of solution (L)}} \\]\r\nFrom this, we can derive a formula that relates molar concentration (\\(c\\)) with amount of solute in moles (\\(n\\)) nand volume of solute in litres (\\(V\\)):\r\n\\[ \\textrm{c}=\\frac{n}{V} \\]\r\n\r\nDilutions\r\nDilution is a process used to lower the concentration of the original solution by adding more solvent. The concentrated solution is known as the stock solution. During this process, the amount of solute present in the solution remains constant before and after the dilution; only the volume changes.\r\nThe following equation shows the relationship between concentration and volume before and after dilution. This formula is built upon the fact that the same amount of solute is present in the solution before (stock solution) and after (diluted solution) the dilution.\r\n\\[ c_{1}V_{1}=c_{2}V_{2} \\]\r\nIn this formula,\r\n\r\n\t\\(c_{1}\\)= concentration of the stock solution\r\n\t\\(V_{1}\\)= volume of the stock solution\r\n\t\\(c_{2}\\)= concentration of the diluted solution\r\n\t\\(V_{2}\\)= volume of the diluted solution\r\n\r\n\r\nWorked example \u2013 representing concentration using percent concentration\r\nCalculate the concentrations of the following solutions and express them in the units indicated.\r\n\r\n\tA sodium chloride solution is prepared by dissolving \\(3.25\\textrm{ g}\\) of sodium chloride in \\(42.50\\textrm{ g}\\) of water.

It classifies elements into categories and makes predictions about elements that have not yet been found by humans. Let's take a look at some key milestones that led to it coming to its current form.\r\n\r\nFrom alchemical table to periodic table\r\nLong before the periodic table, the term \"elements\" referred to earth, air, water, and fire. At the time of ancient Greek philosophy (5th century BCE), the understanding of the chemical elements was represented by the alchemical table. This also ordered elements and substances and their corresponding symbols.\r\nAs more elements were discovered and a modern understanding of chemistry emerged, some components were removed from the table and others were added. Hennig Brand is the first person credited with discovering a modern element, phosphorus. Brand was an alchemist searching for the philosopher's stone. He distilled many substances including human urine, from which he obtained pure phosphorus.\r\n\r\nAdding oxygen to the mix\r\nMany consider Antoine Lavoisier the father of modern chemistry. His work was groundbreaking and instrumental to the current understanding of chemistry. Lavoisier discovered oxygen and hydrogen, and correctly explained the role of oxygen in combustion. He also predicted the existence of silicon. Many people built on the work of Lavoisier, contributing to the periodic table and its elements.\r\n\r\nOrganising the elements\r\nIn 1869, a Russian scientist named Dmitri Mendeleev organised the elements into the table structure we know today. He arranged the elements by atomic mass, starting with the lightest elements. By grouping elements into columns, he was able to correctly predict elements that had not yet been discovered. Mendeleev also knew that the proposed atomic masses of some elements were incorrect, and used his periodic table to correctly predict the actual masses.\r\n\r\nThe development of periodic law\r\nGrouping the elements by atomic mass also led to Mendeleev discovering the periodic law. This law states that by grouping elements by atomic mass, we see trends in their properties. Periodic law has since been used to reliably predict the properties of elements.\r\n\r\n\r\nImage by 2012rc via Wikimedia Commons, licensed under CC BY 3.0 ","excerpt":"The periodic table contains all the elements that we know exist in the universe.

An opposing force for example will lessen another force. However, if the forces (or vector quantities) do not act along exactly the same line, it is difficult to know how they will interact.\r\nThis task is easier if you can break the vectors into components which are parallel, and then find the result by adding or subtracting parallel components. This technique is very important for resolving forces and other vector quantities in physics.\r\n\r\nAs with other types of vectors (displacement, velocity, etc.), a force vector can be thought of as being the sum of several other vectors. Imagining that a single force is made up of several forces can greatly simplify calculations, particularly using two imaginary ones at right angles to each other. Usually broken up into vertical and horizontal components. We discuss how to calculate these components in this module.\r\nComponents of a force\r\nIf you pull on an object with a force \\(\\vec{F}\\) (see diagram below left), the effect is the same as two other people pulling with forces \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) at right angles to each other , one horizontal and the other vertical (see diagram below right).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vector triangle showing the force \\(\\vec{F}\\) and its component vectors \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) is shown.\r\n\r\nThe force \\(\\vec{F}\\) can be imagined as having two parts, or components, \\(\\vec{a}\\) and \\(\\vec{b}\\) that are at right angles to each other. \\(\\vec{a}\\) is usually called the horizontal component and \\(\\vec{b}\\) the vertical component of \\(\\vec{F}\\). The components are often called rectangular components because they are at right angles to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the diagram at right it can be seen that the magnitude of the vectors give:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\sin\\theta &amp; =\\frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\vec{\\left|b\\right|}}{\\left|\\vec{F}\\right|}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nTransposing gives:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\vec{\\left|b\\right|} &amp; =\\vec{\\left|F\\right|}\\sin\\theta \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\cos\\theta &amp; =\\frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left|\\vec{a}\\right|}{\\left|\\vec{F}\\right|}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\nTransposing gives:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\left|\\vec{a}\\right| &amp; =\\left|\\vec{F}\\right|\\cos\\theta \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nCalculate the rectangular components of a force of 10 Newton that acts in a direction of North 30 degrees East?\r\n\r\nSince there is 90 degrees in a right angle triangle we can deduce that the direction of force can be shown as East 60 degrees North.\r\n\r\nThe force and its rectangular components are shown. One component , \\(\\vec{a}\\), is acting to the East , the other , \\(\\vec{b}\\) , is to the North.\r\n\r\nThe magnitudes of these forces can be calculated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\vec{\\left|a\\right|} &amp; =\\vec{\\left|F\\right|}\\cos\\theta\\\\ &amp; =10\\cos60\\\\ &amp; =5Newton \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nalso: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\vec{\\left|b\\right|} &amp; =\\vec{\\left|F\\right|}\\sin\\theta\\\\ &amp; =10\\sin60\\\\ &amp; =8.7Newton. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\nThus, the 10 Newton force can be resolved into two rectangular components: 5 Newton to the East and 8.7 Newton to the North.\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nA small boat is being towed at constant speed along a canal by two men walking along the banks on opposite sides pulling with equal forces of \\(1000\\) Newton at equal angles on ropes attached to the boat. \\(\\theta=60\\) degrees. Calculate the force each man pulls on the rope \\((a)\\) parallel to the bank, and \\((b)\\) at right angles to the bank.\r\n\r\nThe force towards the Jetty an be defined as \\(\\vec{F_{1}}\\) and the force towards the other bank can be defined as \\(\\vec{F_{2}}\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n\r\nThe 1000 Newton force:\r\n\r\n\\((a)\\) A component force parallel to the bank of\r\n\r\n\\(\\left|\\vec{a_{1}}\\right|=\\left|\\vec{F}_{1}\\right|\\cos\\theta=1000\\cos60=500\\) Newton and\r\n\r\n\\(\\vec{\\left|a_{2}\\right|}=\\left|\\vec{F}_{2}\\right|\\cos\\theta=1000\\cos60=500\\) Newton\r\n\r\n\\((b)\\) A component force at right angles to the bank of\r\n\r\n\\(\\left|\\vec{b_{1}}\\right|=\\left|\\vec{F}_{1}\\right|\\sin\\theta=1000\\sin60=866\\) Newton towards the jetty\r\n\r\n\\(\\left|\\vec{b_{2}}\\right|=\\left|\\vec{F}_{2}\\right|\\sin\\theta=1000\\sin60=866\\) Newton away from the jetty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the two components at right angles to the bank are equal in size, but are in opposite directions, so they cancel each other. So the boat will only move parallel to the banks.\r\n\r\nNote: There is zero resultant force at right angles to the Jetty. \\(866\\) N towards the Jetty and \\(866\\) N away from the Jetty.\r\n\r\nThe two components parallel to the banks are in the same direction so the force pulling the boat forwards is:\r\n\r\n\\(\\left|\\vec{a_{1}}\\right|+\\left|\\vec{a_{2}}\\right|=500+500=2\\times F\\cos\\theta\\) \\(=2\\times500=1000\\) Newton.\r\n\r\nThe balancing force causing the boat to move at constant speed is the friction or drag of the boat through the water acting in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nExercise\r\n\r\n \tWhat is the horizontal component of a force 11 Newton acting at \\(\\theta=60\\) degrees to the horizontal?\r\n \tWhat is the northerly component of a wind blowing at \\(15ms^{-1}\\) from the South East?\r\n \tWhat is the vector whose components are 3 Newton horizontally and 4 Newton vertically?\r\n \tWhat are the vertical and horizontal components of a force of 24 Newton acting at \\(\\theta=30\\) degrees to the horizontal?\r\n \tA plane taking off leaves the runway at \\(\\theta=32\\) degrees to the horizontal traveling at \\(180kmh^{-1}.\\) How long will it take to climb to an altitude of \\(1000\\) meter.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"Vector quantities in combination will enhance or counteract each other, depending on their direction.

If this is not the case, the lines do not intersect.\r\n\r\nThe basic approach is:\r\n\r\n \twrite each line in parametric form\r\n \tsolve the simultaneous equations for the parameters\r\n \tif a solution exists the line intersect, if not they don\u2019t intersect.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nFind the point of intersection of the two lines \\(L_{1}\\) and \\(L_{2}\\) where \\(L_{1}\\) is the line represented by the equation \\(\\frac{x-5}{1}=\\frac{y-1}{-1}=\\frac{z-8}{-3}\\) and \\(L_{2}\\) is the line \\(x=1+2s\\) ; \\(y=-4+s\\) ; \\(z=8-2s.\\)\r\nSolution\r\nLine \\(L_{2}\\) is already in parametric form: \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =1+2s &amp; \\left(2\\right)\\\\ y &amp; =-4+s &amp; \\left(3\\right)\\\\ z &amp; =8-2s &amp; \\left(4\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nWe now write \\(L_{1}\\) in parametric form. Set1 As \\(L_{2}\\) is using the parameter \\(s\\) we choose a parameter \\(t\\) in what follows. It doesn\u2019t matter what you use but it must be different from \\(s.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{x-5}{1} &amp; =t\\\\ \\frac{y-1}{-1} &amp; =t\\\\ \\frac{z-8}{-3} &amp; =t. \\end{align*}\\] Rearranging we obtain \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =5+t &amp; \\left(5\\right)\\\\ y &amp; =1-t &amp; \\left(6\\right)\\\\ z &amp; =8-3t &amp; \\left(7\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nTo find the point of intersection of these two lines, we must find a point \\(P\\) that lies on both lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the point of intersection the coordinates for \\(L_{1}\\) will equal the coordinates for \\(L_{2}\\). This means there exist values of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) such that the \\(x,\\) \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) coordinates of the two lines are equal.\r\n\r\nEquating the \\(x,\\) \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) coordinates, we get from equations \\(\\left(2-7\\right):\\)\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\text{for $x,$ }5+t= &amp; 1+2s\\\\ 4= &amp; 2s-t &amp; \\left(8\\right)\\\\ \\text{for $y,$ }1-t= &amp; -4+s\\\\ 5= &amp; s+t &amp; \\left(9\\right)\\\\ \\text{for $z,$ }8-3t= &amp; 8-2s\\\\ 0= &amp; 3t-2s. &amp; \\left(10\\right) \\end{align*}\\] If we add equations \\(\\left(8\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(9\\right)\\) we get \\(9=3s\\) and so \\(s=3\\).\r\n\r\nIf \\(s=3\\) we can substitute this into all of the above equations \\(\\left(8-9\\right)\\) and find that \\(t=2\\). Note that you must check all equations. 2 You must check that \\(s=3\\) and \\(t=2\\) satisfies all three equations. It is common that they satisfy only \\(2\\) of the \\(3\\) equations as shown below in Example 2. \r\n\r\nThe solution is therefore\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} s &amp; =3\\\\ t &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nTo find the point of intersection, substitute the \\(s\\) value into the \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\) equations for \\(L_{2}\\) or substitute the \\(t\\) value into \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\) equations for \\(L_{1}\\). For \\(L_{1},\\)\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =5+t\\\\ &amp; =5+2\\\\ &amp; =7\\\\ y &amp; =1-t\\\\ &amp; =1-2\\\\ &amp; =-1\\\\ z &amp; =8-3t\\\\ &amp; =8-3(2)\\\\ &amp; =2 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nTherefore the point of intersection of the two lines is \\((7,-1,2).\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nDo the lines \\(L_{1}:\\) \\(x=s\\) ; \\(y=-4+s\\) ; \\(z=8-2s\\) and\r\n\\(L_{2}:\\) \\(x=2+2t\\) ; \\(y=-1+t\\) ; \\(z=3-2t\\) intersect?\r\nSolution\r\nEquate the coordinates of each line. We have: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{for $x,$ }s= &amp; 2+2t\\\\ s-2t= &amp; 2 &amp; \\left(11\\right)\\\\ \\text{for $y,$ }-4+s= &amp; -1+t\\\\ s-t= &amp; 3 &amp; \\left(12\\right)\\\\ \\text{for $z,$ }8-2s= &amp; 3-2t\\\\ -2s+2t= &amp; -5. &amp; \\left(13\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Subtract equation \\(\\left(11\\right)\\) from equation \\(\\left(12\\right)\\): \\[\\begin{align*} s-t-\\left(s-2t\\right) &amp; =3-2\\\\ t &amp; =1. \\end{align*}\\] Substitute \\(t=1\\) in equation \\(\\left(11\\right)\\): \\[\\begin{align*} s-2\\left(1\\right) &amp; =2\\\\ s &amp; =4. \\end{align*}\\] We have a solution namely, \\(t=1\\), \\(s=4\\) but this must be checked with all equations. The proposed solution satisfies equations \\(\\left(11\\right)\\) and equation \\(\\left(12\\right)\\) but substituting in equation \\(\\left(13\\right)\\), \\[\\begin{align*} -2\\left(4\\right)+2\\left(1\\right) &amp; =-5\\\\ -8+2 &amp; =-5\\\\ -6 &amp; =-5. \\end{align*}\\] The last statement is clearly untrue.

Here, the axes are exactly the same as the figure above. To find the shortest distance from a point \\(A\\) to the aqua colored plane we first choose any point on the plane \\(P\\) as shown below. Now define a vector from \\(P\\) to \\(A\\), \\(\\overrightarrow{PA}\\). The shortest distance \\(d\\) is then1 This is sometimes called the scalar resolute of \\(\\overrightarrow{PA}\\) in the direction of \\(\\hat{n}\\). Since the unit vector \\[\\begin{align*} \\hat{n} &amp; =\\frac{\\vec{n}}{\\left|\\vec{n}\\right|} \\end{align*}\\] we can express the distance as \\[\\begin{align*} d= &amp; \\overrightarrow{PA}\\cdot\\hat{n}\\\\ = &amp; \\overrightarrow{PA}\\cdot\\frac{\\vec{n}}{\\left|\\vec{n}\\right|}. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} d &amp; =\\overrightarrow{PA}\\cdot\\hat{n} &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\hat{n}\\) is a unit normal to the plane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis may be easier to understand if we rotate the picture above so that we view the aqua plane \u201cedge on\u201d as shown below.2 Note that if we take this viewpoint, the distance \\(d\\) does not change as we rotate the plane about the unit normal vector.

In this case we write \\(P\\) as a function of \\(b\\) but identical results are obtained is we make \\(P\\) a function of \\(a.\\)  \\[\\begin{align*} a &amp; =10-b \\end{align*}\\] so \\[\\begin{align*} P &amp; =\\left(10-b\\right)b\\\\ &amp; =10b-b^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Now \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{dP}{db} &amp; =10-2b. \\end{align*}\\] For a maximum or minimum, \\(dP\/db=0,\\) \\[\\begin{align*} 10-2b &amp; =0\\\\ 2b &amp; =10\\\\ b &amp; =5. &amp; \\left(2.2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] But \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{d^{2}P}{db^{2}} &amp; =-2\\\\ &amp; &lt;0 \\end{align*}\\] and we have a maximum. Substituting \\(b=5\\) in \\(\\left(2.1\\right)\\) we find \\(a=5.\\)\r\n\r\nHence the two numbers adding to \\(10\\) and having a maximal product are \\(a=b=5\\) and the maximum product is \\(25.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\nFind the minimum value of the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}-5x+6\\).\r\nSolution\r\nWe have \\[\\begin{align*} f'\\left(x\\right) &amp; =2x-5. &amp; \\left(3.1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] For a maximum or minimum we know\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} f'\\left(x\\right) &amp; =0\\\\ 2x-5 &amp; =0\\\\ 2x &amp; =5\\\\ x &amp; =\\frac{5}{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Since \\[\\begin{align*} f^{\"}\\left(x\\right) &amp; =2\\\\ &amp; &gt;0 \\end{align*}\\] for all values of \\(x\\) we know we have a minimum. Hence the minimum value of \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{2}-5x+6\\) occurs at \\(5\/2.\\)\r\n\r\nThe minimum value of the function is \\[\\begin{align*} f\\left(x\\right) &amp; =\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}-5\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)+6\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{25}{4}-\\frac{25}{2}+\\frac{12}{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{25}{4}-\\frac{50}{4}+\\frac{24}{4}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{4}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n \tFind two positive numbers whose sum is 18 such that the sum of their squares is a minimum.\r\n \tFind the turning point of the parabola defined by \\(y=f(x)=5x^{2}-30x+17\\).\r\n \tWhat is the maximum area that can be enclosed if a rectangle is created with a piece of wire \\(48\\,cm\\) long?\r\n \tThe annual profit \\(P\\) made on a garment is related to the number \\(n\\) that are produced by the formula \\(P(n)=300n-7200-0.2n^{2}.\\) How many garments should be produced to maximize profit?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page, D8 Maxima and minima (PDF 249KB)\r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"How do you find the maximum (highest) or minimum (lowest) value of a curve?

In fact, it was not until 1833 that people began calling themselves \"scientists\". Before that time, people studied natural philosophy, the study of nature, causes, astrology and many more subjects. Astrology, medicine, magic, and experiments were used in alchemy to understand the world and to create new substances. What we now think of as science came from natural philosophy and alchemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto by Joanna Kosinska on  Unsplash\r\n\r\nTurning lead to gold\r\nAlchemy was the art of attempting to transmute or to change metals, particularly lead, into gold. For many thousands of years, alchemists had tried to unlock the secrets of matter, to bring great wealth and create a cure for all diseases. Alchemists believed that by studying the stars, metals, herbs and other substances, they could find a way to create the philosopher's stone. The philosopher's stone was believed to cure all disease, turn metals to gold and make people immortal.\r\nFor over four thousand years and across many countries, alchemy was practised by people who believed that matter could be classified and understood through experiments. We can describe alchemy as the start of the system of modern science in many parts of the world. Of the modern sciences, chemistry is the closest to alchemy in name and in practice. Classifying matter into different elements, states and categories was an alchemical pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe alchemical table\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may recognise some of the elements included on the alchemical table. Some of the metals named here are still very much a part of modern science and our understanding of matter. Other components, such as the four elements, are no longer part of scientific beliefs.\r\n\r\nChemistry is born\r\nRobert Boyle published \"The Sceptical Chymist\" at the end of the 17th century. This book disproved the idea that matter was made of a mix of some or all of the four elements; earth, fire, air and wind. Instead, Boyle used new equipment and experiments to prove his theories about the world. This emphasis on experiments that could be repeated anywhere and give the same results was not new, but Boyle helped to set the standards for the modern chemist.\r\nIn the 19th century, the scientific method and the separation of the sciences into specific disciplines became the hallmarks of modern science. \r\nAlchemical symbols\r\nThe three principles:\r\n\r\n\tSulfur\r\n\tSalt\r\n\tMercury\r\n\r\nThe four elements\r\n\r\n\tFire\r\n\tAir\r\n\tWater\r\n\tEarth\r\n\tThe elements\r\n\r\nPlanets and metals\r\n\r\n\tVenus or copper\r\n\tJupiter or tin\r\n\tSun or gold\r\n\tMars or iron\r\n\tMoon or silver\r\n\tMercury or quicksilver\r\n\tSaturn or lead\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Isaac Newton would not have said he was a scientist, but he would have said he was an alchemist, or someone who practised alchemy.

This understanding is vital to creating large farms that can feed today's populations.\r\nWe provide plants with compounds containing these elements through mixtures called fertilisers.

It is generally made up of one main idea and a group of supporting sentences. Paragraphs are the basic unit for building longer pieces of writing.\r\n\r\nThe importance of paragraphs\r\nThis short video explains why writing good paragraphs in your assessment tasks is important. It also introduces the easy-to-follow TEEL structure for your paragraphs to improve your writing skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the TEEL structure\r\n\r\nWell structured paragraphs are important because if the information is well organised it is easier to read. The TEEL strategy is very helpful for knowing what should be included in a paragraph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tTopic sentence (contains the main idea and is usually first in the paragraph)\r\n \tExplain\r\n \tEvidence and example (use references)\r\n \tLink (refer back or sum up main idea) - optional\r\n\r\nSample paragraph\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParagraphs activity\r\nTest your skills! Try this short quiz to see if you can identify the most appropriate topic sentence for the paragraph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf information is organised and your main points are clear, you will get better marks. Making your ideas and arguments stand out is mostly done through having clear and well-structured paragraphs. A really good way to write paragraphs is to use the TEEL structure:\r\n\r\n \tTopic Sentence: The topic of the paragraph\r\n \tExplain: Why is the topic important?\r\n \tEvidence\/Example: Support the topic (references)\r\n \tLink: Link back to the topic\r\n\r\nThis is an example:\r\n\r\n\"One factor within the team that seems to be important is the notion of team cohesiveness. Team cohesiveness enables a diverse group of individuals to work towards common goals. Addison (1996, p. 107) argues that highly cohesive teams 'are more effective at achieving goals they set for themselves, and have higher member satisfaction'. For example, cohesive teams are more likely to have high morale (Smith 1996) and the ability to cooperate, and so work effectively together (McAlfee &amp; Champagne 1987). Therefore, team cohesiveness enhances team effectiveness.\"\r\n\r\nSee how the topic sentence tells you the main idea of the paragraph. The rest just supports this main idea. If it doesn't relate to the main idea, it doesn't belong in the paragraph. It is sort of like a formula for writing.\r\n\r\nLinking your ideas helps the paragraph to flow and it shows how your analysis has developed. Have a look at the examples. The paragraph with linking words flows and it easy to read.\r\n\r\nSeparate sentences: \"Many countries are in recession\", and \"China's economy is growing\".\u00a0 These are two separate ideas, so how do we link them?\r\n\r\nRevised sentence: \"Although many countries are in recession, China's economy is growing\". The linking word in the paragraph here is \"Although\".\r\n\r\nHere are a few more linking words: \"furthermore\u2026\", \"in addition\u2026\", \"however\u2026\", \"as a result\u2026\", \"although\u2026\". \"therefore\u2026\".\r\n\r\nThe paragraph with linking words flows and it easy to read. Without linking words, it is disjointed and more difficult to follow. By using linking words, it looks like you have thought more deeply about your research.\r\n\r\nFor more information about paragraphs, try the tutorial.\r\n\r\nThanks for watching.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe missing sentence will be wrapped in square brackets.

The information on this page will help get you started.\r\n\r\nPart 1: What is it and why?\r\nThis video introduces the concept of the case study and identifies how case studies differ to other written assignments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2: Research and writing\r\nThis video provides tips on how to research and structure paragraphs in order to keep a patient centred emphasis in the writing.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe most important thing in writing up a case study report is that first, second, and thirdly: It is about the patient, not the condition nor the treatment. Students often put the emphasis on the condition or the treatment because the question usually focuses on this. While you need to explore these things, you still have to bring it back to the patient, and keep the patient central to the whole assignment.\r\n\r\nWe can understand if busy medical professionals start to see their patients in terms of a condition to be fixed, or a procedure to be performed. But ideally, we should remember that a patient is a person with a complex array of needs and preferences. This means that a simple textbook answer is not always best for them.\r\n\r\nIn your career, you will need to negotiate adjustments and anticipate problems particular to the patient. It does not make sense to discuss a condition in isolation from the individual. Each patient has their own unique kaleidoscope of history, personality type, fears, medical challenges, needs during recovery, so forth and so on. You need to see their condition or their treatment overall, as part of the whole person. Writing a case study teaches you to do that, if you don\u2019t explore the condition or treatment as part of a holistic system, you case study becomes theoretical, it becomes another essay.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s compare the case study to the essays you might have already written. The case study in nursing explores a particular patient\u2019s situation, while your essays will more likely have focused on disease, a treatment, a concept, or a system. A case study is very grounded in the real and the now, even if the patient is a hypothetical invention. It still provides some fairly authentic experience with dealing with an individual patient.\r\n\r\nEssays, on the other hand, tend to be literature-based. Of course, you need to do a lot of research and reading for your case study too, but the difference is for a case study you must always view and evaluate the information in the context of your patient. So in a case study, you need to show that you can find and apply information to you patient. For an essay you need to look at the information itself, pull it apart and evaluate it for its own sake.\r\n\r\nSo even if the question looks like an essay, don\u2019t be distracted. There is still an expectation to relate this to the patient. It is possible to explore the content and theory in a generalised way throughout the assignment, but the beginning of the assignment (and the beginning of each paragraph, in fact) should foreground you're patient and their relationship to this theory.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAn essay, as opposed to a case study, usually has an question or a thesis which defines the boundaries of what you research, You aim to keep it within those parameters. and you delve as deeply as you can into the material. It loses focus if you include stuff outside of the topic.\r\n\r\nWith a case study, however, your focus is the patient so you need to cast your net widely and generously at first to find something that is relevant to them. And then when you find something relevant, you need to research deeply. So, doing a good case study report involves a lot more reading than you might think. You\u2019ll have to research both generally and deeply.\r\n\r\nThere can be a lot of research, and fairly unguided research involved in a case study. Don\u2019t assume it\u2019s like a reading comprehension exercise, the problems are not always clearly defined and the solutions have not necessarily been covered in lectures. Think of your case study as a mystery puzzle with a few clues scattered through it.\r\n\r\nIn reality, patients do not arrive with instructions, so it\u2019s up to the professional to notice that it is obvious and to think outside of the box. It is up to you to anticipate problems for the patient, it is up to you to follow through with the threads of any clues, and to see if they offer any valuable information, and these may only be hinted at indirectly. With years of nursing experience, the clues and danger signs get easier to spot, but it is very challenging for a beginner if you don\u2019t know what to look for, and that is why the broad reading is important.\r\n\r\nSo, every piece of information about your patient is valuable. When the information is given in the assignment, the facts are not random facts, they have usually been included for a reason, so use them and use them as much as you can. You may, on the other hand, have been told very little in the assignment and be expected to elicit the information yourself from the patient, through a blog, or a question-and-answer session. Asking for more details about their own condition just gives you more details about their condition, and unless you have some reasoning in mind for asking about that, more details per se is usually not that very helpful.\r\n\r\nInstead, ask about things that may affect the treatment or recovery; ask about things that may complicate matters. Smoking, relevant illnesses, lack of family support, strenuous lifestyles or jobs are all factors that may generate important decisions about how the patient is treated or cared for. The secret to keeping it about the patient is to keep them foremost into the discussion. You do this by making them the subject of each paragraph, and you do this by making them feature in the topic sentence: at the beginning and, if possible, a summary sentence at the end.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of a paragraph, you have more flexibility to talk about the procedure or the condition in a more general way. But, at the end of the day, you need to remind us of how this is important for your patient. If you don\u2019t, your writing becomes an essay rather than a case study. And if you feel like you\u2019re being asked to research and to discuss material that is not directly relevant to your patient, you can make it relevant by at least explaining why it is not relevant. Remember, everything you write about should be in relation to your patient.\r\n\r\nSo remember, it is all about the patient, keep everything relevant to the patient; keep the patient in mind throughout the research and the writing. Explore and discuss what the question requires, but theory for the sake of theory should be avoided. Your mission is to find the best solutions available for your patient, and develop the best understanding that you can of your patient.\r\n\r\nYou have now complete the Case Study module.

Here you will learn how to go through the process of writing a clear and concise text.\r\n\r\nVideo: Writing an artist statement\r\nThis video explains an approach to writing an artist statement. It is based on textile design but can be easily adapted to suit other mediums. It describes the steps to identifying the key components of the statement and then shows how to write it. Specifically, it introduces the concepts of brainstorming, organising and ordering your ideas, and then the writing process. There are models and additional resources to help you draft your statement, and there is a short tutorial outlining the essentials of the artist biography.\r\n\r\nVocabulary tips\r\nHere are some vocabulary tips to help you through your writing process.\r\nVocabulary 'do's\r\n\r\nVocabulary 'don't's\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWriting a artist statement and biography\r\nSlide 1: Introduction\r\nSlide description:\r\nSlide title: Introduction: Artist statement\r\nDevelop\r\nA page with the title: Professional document: reflecting on these questions:\r\n\r\n \tWhat is your approach to design?\r\n \tWhat values or beliefs underpin your work?\r\n \tHow do you work?\r\n \tWhere do you see yourself in the future?\r\n \tWho inspired you?\r\n\r\nNarration: The skills you learn in this tutorial will help you in your professional life. Where you might use these statements as a whole, or you may take parts of it to use separately.\r\n\r\nAn artist statement is a important professional document that reflects on these following five questions:\r\n\r\n \tWhat is your approach to design?\r\n \tWhat values or beliefs underpin your work?\r\n \tHow do you work?\r\n \tWhere do you see yourself in the future?\r\n \tWho inspired you?\r\n\r\nSlide 2: Overview\r\nSlide description:\r\nSlide title: 1. Mind mapping\r\nA three-step process is mapped out in three blocks; in-between them are arrows pointing in the right direction. Demonstrating a step-by-step approach when developing a mind-map.\r\n\r\n \tBrainstorm: Ideas and words around the reflective questions and free write\r\n \tOrganise: Your brainstorm into order under each question to identify topics\r\n \tOrder: The topics and then individual points in your mind map\r\n\r\nNarration: To develop your artist statement the following steps to a mind map are useful and will help you find suitable words and ideas. The first step is to brainstorm to generate ideas. Next you need to organise the ideas into categories and finally develop your ideas into a map or plan.\r\nSlide 3: Brainstorm\r\nSlide description: A mind map example. The topic \u2018Me as a textile designer\u2019 is written at the center of the page. Brainstorm ideas begin to appear around the topic.\r\n\r\nNarration: At this stage all ideas are acceptable and the aim is to get as many ideas as possible ideas that could go towards writing about yourself as a textile designer.\r\nSlide 4: Organise\r\nSlide description: Building on top of the previous example. Connections are made between certain words by using different colours.\r\n\r\nNarration: Step two involves finding connections between the ideas in relation to the five reflective questions. Colour is a useful way to distinguish connections around the different questions.\r\nSlide 5: Order\r\nSlide description: A new mind-map is created with the topic \u2018Me as a textile designer\u2019 written in the center of the page. This time, the five reflective questions are written on the page:\r\n\r\n \tWhat is your approach to design?\r\n \tWhat values or beliefs underpin your work?\r\n \tHow do you work?\r\n \tWhere do you see yourself in the future?\r\n \tWho inspired you?\r\n\r\nThe connections that were identified from the previous mind-map are organised into these categories.\r\n\r\nNarration: The final stage is to order the ideas into groups around the questions and create a spidergram or something similiar to complete your mind map you will use this as a plan for your writing.\r\nSlide 6: Overview\r\nSlide description:\r\nSlide title: The writing process\r\nA three-step process is mapped out in three blocks; in-between them are arrows pointing in the right direction demonstrating a step-by-step approach during the writing process. The steps are:\r\n\r\n \tIdentify: Themes and ideas using your mind-map\r\n \tBegin writing: By creating topic sentences for each of the paragraph\r\n \tDevelop your ideas: By structuring your paragraphs using TEEL\r\n\r\nNarration: Now, it's time to start writing your artist statement. First look at each category in your mind-map and identify the main theme or idea that answers each question. Complete the writing processes by then structuring your paragraphs based on the mind map.\r\nSlide 7: Part 1 - Identify\r\nSlide description:\r\nSlide title: Using your mind-map\r\nLook at the bigger picture of what you are trying to say and identify the overall themes or ideas.\r\nE.g. What values or beliefs underpin your work?\r\n\r\n \tIdeas + energy flow\r\n \tCollective goal\r\n \tEnthusiasm eg. \u2018Full Drop Collective\u2019\r\n \tHolistic: concept to product\r\n\r\nTheme identified from these points is collaboration.\r\n\r\nNarration: Here is an example of how you would identify one main theme from each list that will become the topic sentence for each paragraph. In this case all the ideas are about working with other people and sharing ideas, so a useful word here is collaboration. This will become the topic of your paragraph.\r\nSlide 8: Part 2 - Identify\r\nSlide description: The main themes are written under their relevant sections on the mind map.\r\n\r\nNarration: Notice how the main themes have been identified for each part of the mind map.\r\nSlide 9: Begin writing\r\nSlide description: Start by writing a topic sentence for each paragraph. Use the themes you have identified for each question.\r\nFor example:\r\nQ. What beliefs and values underpin your work?\r\nStep 1: Start by directly answering the question even if it seems predictable.\r\nFor example: I believe that collaboration is the most important thing for my work.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Now change the topic to make it stronger or more interesting.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n \tCollaboration is key for me.\r\n \tCollaboration is essential to my work.\r\n\r\nNarration: To write a topic sentence for your paragraph, start by writing a direct answer to the question then you can rewrite the sentence to improve it.\r\nSlide 10: Develop your ideas\r\nSlide description:\r\nSlide title: Paragraph writing\r\nComplete your paragraph by following the TEEL structure\r\nTEEL STRUCTURE:\r\n\r\n \tTOPIC: Write a topic sentence containing the main idea. This is your voice and your idea\r\n \tEXPLANATION: Write one or more sentences that explain or elaborate on the main idea. This shows your reflection and analysis of the topic.\r\n \tEVIDENCE: Illustrate using examples from your own work and your experience, references to other artists and designers you admire and from your knowledge of history and theory.\r\n \tLINK: sum up by referring back to the main idea\r\n\r\nNarration: Now you can use the rest of the information from the mind map to complete the paragraph by writing supporting sentences that explain and give examples. The TEEL structure is a very helpful framework for structuring your paragraphs and making sure that you cover everything that is important.\r\nSlide 11: Begin writing\r\nSlide description: Visual representation of the narration: a hamburger animated in layers:\r\n\r\n \tTop bun = topic sentence.\r\n \tTomato and cheese = explanation.\r\n \tMeat and lettuce = evidence and examples.\r\n \tBottom bun = linking sentence.\r\n\r\nNarration: The hamburger is a good metaphor for a paragraph. Notice how the bread roll which is the topic sentence at the beginning and the linking sentence at the end hold the ingredients together because without it you don't have a hamburger!\r\nSlide 12: Begin writing\r\nDescription: Using the TEEL paragraph (example):\r\n\r\n \tTopic sentence: Collaboration is key for me.\r\n \tExplanation: The ideas and energy which grow when a group of like-minded individuals are moving towards a collective goal fills me with enthusiasm and makes me feel like anything is possible.\r\n \tEvidence: At the end of 2011, I started working as a part of Full Drop Collective, a group of six females textile designers exploring the possibilities in designer-maker goods and collaborative projects.\r\n \tLink: Being part of a project from start to finish and thinking about design in a holistic sense from concept to product has been important part of my practice.\r\n\r\nNarration: No Narration.\r\nSlide 14: Introduction\r\nSlide description:\r\nDevelop an artist biography with the following:\r\n\r\n \tAn introduction to yourself\r\n \tA summary of your resume\r\n \tYour approach to your work\r\n\r\nNarration: An artist biography is an introduction to you and a summary to your resume and approach to your work.\r\nSlide 15: What is it for?\r\nSlide description:\r\n\r\n \tExhibition proposals \/ galleries \/ curators\r\n \tWebsites\r\n \tCatalogues prefacing your images\r\n \tIndustry \/ potential employers\r\n \tRecruitment agencies\r\n \tPublications of an kind \/ media.\r\n\r\nNarration: Your artist biography needs to be redesigned for each audience. Here are some examples of where your biography would be used.\r\nSlide 16: What is in it?\r\nSlide description: A pyramid diagram (base at the top then narrowing down), broken down into four different sections. This is a representation of importance.\r\nArtist name and work\r\n\r\n \tMaterials and techniques that are employed by the artist\r\n \tInfluences on your work\r\n\r\nBrief history\r\n\r\n \tEducation, training\r\n\r\nProfessional experience\r\n\r\n \tExperience in your field eg. Projects, commissions, own businesses\r\n\r\nPhilosophy \/ ethos\r\n\r\n \tShort description of what the artist would like to accomplish with their art\r\n\r\nNarration : The artist biography is structured with the most important point at the beginning, which is who the artist is and their name. Followed by a brief history experience and summary of their philosophy.\r\nSlide 17: Example: Artist biography?\r\nSlide description:\r\nArtist biography (example):\r\n[Artist name and work] Tania Swinn is a textile designer who creates softly textured fabrics in vibrant colours. Her work features botanical inspired designs using recycled materials. [Brief history]Born and raised in Tasmania, Tania received her Bachelor in Textile Design from RMIT. [Professional history] She has exhibited widely in Australia and recently worked on projects with DESSI. [Ethos\/philosophy] She is currently completing a placement with Ilke. The emphasis is on the quality of workmanship and the respect for sustainability.\r\n\r\nNarration: No Narration.\r\n","excerpt":"Writing an artist statement has several stages.

The following tips guide you through how to write in plain English.\r\n\r\nShort and simple sentences\r\nOne of the ways to make your writing easier to read and understand is to use short and simple sentences. Keep your sentences short (15\u201320 words) by removing unnecessary words.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n \tThey are easier to read and understand.\r\n \tLonger sentences can lead to misunderstandings and confusion if read quickly.\r\n \tLong sentences make ideas less clear.\r\n\r\nCompare:\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 1 (27 words)\r\nA number of proposals have been received and, after much consideration weighing the pros and cons, it has been decided to award the contract to Wright Industries.\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 2 (16 words)\r\nA number of proposals have been received and we have awarded the contract to Wright Industries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second sentence is easier to read. Sometimes long sentences may be necessary, however too many make it difficult for the reader to comprehend.\r\nUse clear and concise language\r\nUse simple, clear and direct language. Use strong verbs (doing\/action words) rather than noun phrases.\r\nCompare:\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 1\r\nWe undertook a comparison of computers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 2\r\nWe compared computers.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth sentences have the same meaning. Using the verb 'compared' rather than the noun phrase 'undertook a comparison' makes the second sentence clear and direct.\r\n\r\n\r\nMain idea at the beginning\r\nWhere possible, put the main idea or key information at the start of the sentence to make it easier to comprehend.\r\nCompare:\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 1a\r\nA number of proposals have been considered by the committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 1b\r\nThe committee considered a number of proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn sentence 1b, the key information has been placed at the beginning of the sentence for easier comprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 2a\r\nYou sent the wrong documents and we could not complete the hand-over in time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 2b\r\nThe wrong documents were sent and we could not complete the hand-over in time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the example above, the tone in sentence 2a is accusatory. Sentence 2b would be more appropriate as it does not attribute blame.\r\nUse verbs instead of abstract nouns\r\nIf you are looking for a way to make your writing easier to read, one method is using verbs instead of abstract nouns. This pages explains how this can be done.\r\nSome commonly used abstract nouns and their verb equivalents are listed below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract noun\r\nVerb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimplementation\r\nimplement\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestigation\r\ninvestigate\r\n\r\n\r\nagreement\r\nagree\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscussion\r\ndiscuss\r\n\r\n\r\narrangement\r\narrange\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these pairs of sentences, the B sentences use verbs instead of abstract nouns. As a result, they are easier to read.\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 1a:\r\nThe implementation of the plan went ahead as scheduled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 1b:\r\nThe plan was implemented as scheduled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 2a:\r\nChina and America will hold discussions on trade when they meet next February.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 2b:\r\nChina and America will discuss trade when they meet next February.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 3a:\r\nThere was broad agreement amongst all parties to carry on meeting regularly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSentence 3b:\r\nAll parties agreed to carry on meeting regularly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReplace these \u2018wordy\u2019 phrases with a more concise alternative.\r\n\r\n1.

Tables come in different layouts, but this table (a portion of the table is shown below) gives the proportion to the left of a chosen z-value of up to 2 decimal places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can interpret our proportions or percentages as probabilities:\r\n\r\n\\(\\Pr\\left(z&lt;0.00\\right)=0.500\\) or \\(50\\)%.1 This corresponds to the number in line with \\(0.0\\) in the left hand column and \\(0.00\\) in the top row of the table.\r\n\r\n\\(\\Pr\\left(z&lt;0.03\\right)=0.512\\) or \\(51.2\\)%.2 This corresponds to the number \\(0.0\\) in the left hand column and \\(0.03\\) in the top row of the table.\r\n\r\n\\(\\Pr\\left(z&lt;0.75\\right)=0.7734\\) or \\(51.2\\)%.3 This corresponds to the number in line with \\(0.7\\) in the left hand column and \\(0.05\\) in the top row of the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that a graphics calculator or a computer can also be used to find areas, proportions and probabilities in a normal distribution, rather than the table used here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nIn a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be less than 1.28?\r\nSolution\r\nDraw a diagram as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are looking for the shaded area to the left of \\(z=1.28.\\) Using the following table we find that the area to the left is \\(0.8997\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the percentage is \\(89.97\\)%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nIn a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be more than 1.28?\r\nSolution\r\nWe want to find the percentage area shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot read areas to the right of a z-value directly from the table at the end of this module. Instead we observe that: 100% of all values lie under the curve. The area to the left of the shaded region is the same as part a). So the percentage of values to the right of \\(1.28\\) will be \\(100\\)% minus the percentage to the left of \\(1.28\\).

But we know from Example 1 that 89.97% of values are less than 1.28. We also know \\(50\\)% of values lie to the left of the mean \\(\\left(z=0\\right)\\) because this is a property of our symmetrical bell curve. Therefore the percentage of values between \\(0\\) and 1.28 is \\(89.97\\)% \\(-\\) \\(50\\)% = \\(39.97\\)%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 4\r\nIn a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be greater than \\(-1.28\\)?\r\nSolution\r\nWe want to find the percentage area shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot usually look up negative values in the table.4 There are some normal distribution tables that include negative z values. But we know that the bell curve is symmetrical as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe area to the right of \\(-1.28\\) is the same as the area to the left of \\(1.28\\). Therefore the percentage of values greater than \\(-1.28\\) is \\(89.97\\)% from Example 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 5\r\nIn a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be between \\(-1.28\\) and \\(1.28\\)?\r\nSolution\r\nTo find this area we use the symmetry of the graph.\r\n\r\nObserve that the area between \\(-1.28\\) and \\(0\\) is exactly the same as the area between \\(0\\) and \\(1.28\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find this area we use the symmetry of the graph.\r\n\r\nObserve that the area between \\(-1.28\\) and \\(0\\) is exactly the same as the area between \\(0\\) and \\(1.28\\).\r\n\r\nWe know the area between \\(0\\) and \\(1.28=39.97\\)% because we found it in Example 3 above.\r\n\r\nTherefore the percentage of the graph between \\(-1.28\\) and \\(1.28\\) is \\(2\\times39.97\\)% \\(=79.8\\)%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable\r\nThe proportion of the area under the curve to the left of a chosen value of z is given in the table below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n \tIn a standard normal distribution what percentage of values will be\r\n\\(\\quad\\)(a) less than \\(1.95\\)?\r\n\\(\\quad\\)(b) less than \\(-1.95\\)?\r\n\\(\\quad\\)(c)between \\(-1.95\\) and \\(0\\)?\r\n\\(\\quad\\)(d) greater than \\(1.95\\)?\r\n\\(\\quad\\)(e) between \\(-1.95\\) and \\(1.95.\\)\r\n\r\nNote that answers may vary slightly depending on whether tables or calculators are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tIn a standard normal distribution what proportion of values lie between \\(-0.5\\) and \\(1.5\\)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tIn a standard normal distribution what proportion of values lie outside the interval \\(\\pm1.7\\)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tGiven that a value in a standard normal distribution is greater than -1 what is the probability that it will be less than 2?

The mean of a normal distribution corresponds to a standardised score of \\(0\\) and we can see that \\(\\mu\\pm\\sigma\\rightarrow\\pm1\\), \\(\\mu\\pm2\\sigma\\rightarrow\\pm2\\) and \\(\\mu\\pm3\\sigma\\rightarrow\\pm3\\).\r\n\r\n\\(z-\\)scores\r\nFor other values of the mean and standard deviation, we can use the formula \\[\\begin{align*} z &amp; =\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\end{align*}\\] to find \\(z\\) scores (where the \\(z\\) score is the number of standard deviations away from the mean).\r\n\r\nFor example, if we have a Normal Distribution with a mean of \\(1.2\\) and a standard deviation of \\(0.4\\), then to find the standardised score for \\(x=1.7\\):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} z &amp; =\\frac{(x-\\mu)}{\\sigma}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{(1.7-1.2)}{0.4}\\\\ &amp; =1.25 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nA score of \\(1.7\\) in the distribution with mean \\(1.2\\) and standard deviation \\(0.4\\) is equivalent to a standardised score of \\(1.25\\). Alternatively, we could say that the score \\(1.7\\) is \\(1.25\\) standard deviations above the mean for that distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalculating probabilities using \\(z-\\)scores\r\nOnce we have converted the scores of our distribution into standard scores or \\(z\\)-scores we can use normal distribution tables to calculate precise percentages and probabilities.\r\n\r\nThe normal distribution is a continuous distribution, so we can find the probability that \\(x\\) is greater than or less than a particular value, but not that \\(x\\) is equal to a particular value.\r\n\r\nBecause the total area under the standardised curve is \\(1\\), \\(\\Pr\\left(z&lt;\\beta\\right)\\) is equivalent to the area to the left of \\(\\beta.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nIf the mean maximum temperature for Melbourne in January is \\(25.9^{\\circ}\\)C with a standard deviation of \\(2.1^{\\circ}\\) what is the probability that the mean maximum temperature for January \\(2015\\) will be above \\(28^{\\circ}\\)C?\r\n\r\nFirst draw a diagram.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =28\\\\ z &amp; =\\frac{(x-\\mu)}{\\sigma}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{(28-25.9)}{2.1}\\\\ &amp; =1.\\\\ \\Pr\\left(x&gt;28\\right) &amp; =\\Pr\\left(z&gt;1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =1-\\Pr\\left(z&lt;1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =1-0.8413\\ \\ \\left(0.8413\\textrm{ is from the table at end of this module}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =0.1587. \\end{align*}\\] That is, the probability that the mean maximum temperature for January \\(2015\\) will be above \\(28^{\\circ}\\)C is \\(0.1587.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nThe top \\(0.5\\)% of students applying for Stato university are given full scholarships.

They play a crucial role in many aspects of science and technology.\r\n\r\nBohr planetary (particle) model and Schr\u00f6dinger's wave mechanical model\r\nElectrons have historically been described as tiny particles that revolve around the nucleus in circular orbits similar to the solar system. This is Bohr's particle model. However, this model overly simplifies the path of electrons within atoms and was eventually rejected.\r\n\r\nThe modern understanding of electron behaviour is based on Schr\u00f6dinger's wave mechanical model. \r\nThe wave model shows that electrons don't have exact paths. Instead, they exist in regions of space where they are likely to be found. These regions are called orbitals. In this model, electrons occupy a three-dimensional space around the nucleus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen an electron's wave fits perfectly within an orbital, it creates a stable energy level, known as a \"stationary state.\" This means the electron's energy is quantised, meaning that it can exist only in certain allowed states. These stable energy levels are crucial for understanding how electrons behave in atoms, influencing how atoms absorb and emit energy, and determining the chemical properties of elements. Orbitals, therefore, provide a framework for predicting where electrons are likely to be and how they will interact with other atoms in chemical reactions.\r\n\r\nElectron energy levels\r\nThe space where electrons move around the nucleus is divided into subspaces known as shells, subshells and orbitals.\r\n\r\nElectron shells\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElectron subshells\r\nWithin each electron shell are subshells. The number of subshells within a shell is the same as the shell number. For example, the \\(n=3\\) shell contains \\(3\\textrm{ subshells}\\) and the \\(n=6\\) shell contains \\(6\\textrm{ subshells}\\). Subshells are labeled as \\(s,p,d\\) and \\(f\\). Each subshell contains a certain number of electrons:\r\n\r\n\tAn \\(s\\) subshell contains up to \\(2\\) electrons.\r\n\tA \\(p\\) subshell contains up to \\(6\\) electrons.\r\n\tA \\(d\\) subshell contains up to \\(10\\) electrons.\r\n\tA \\(f\\) subshell contains up to \\(14\\) electrons.\r\n\r\nLet's consider the \\(n=4\\) shell. This shell contains \\(4\\) subshells, which are labeled as \\(4s\\), \\(4p\\), \\(4d\\), and \\(4f\\). Remember, the \\(4s\\) subshell can hold up to \\(2\\) electrons, the \\(4p\\) subshell can hold up to \\(6\\) electrons, the \\(4d\\) subshell can accommodate up to \\(10\\) electrons, and the \\(4f\\) subshell can contain up to \\(14\\) electrons. Altogether, the \\(n=4\\) shell can hold a maximum of \\(2+6+10+14=32\\) electrons.\r\nElectron subshells are filled in order of increasing energy. The figure shows the electron filling order. Generally, shells fill from \\(1\\) to \\(2\\) to \\(3\\) and subshells, from \\(s\\) to \\(p\\) to \\(d\\), but there is an exception. Subshell \\(4s\\) has lower energy than subshell \\(3d\\); therefore, \\(4s\\) fills before \\(3d\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElectron orbitals\r\nWithin each electron subshell are electron orbitals. Each electron orbital can hold up to two electrons, where one spin upwards and the other spins downwards. This means that:\r\n\r\n\tAn \\(s\\) subshell, which contains up to \\(2\\) electrons, has one orbital.\r\n\tA \\(p\\) subshell, which contains up to \\(6\\) electrons, has three orbitals.\r\n\tA \\(d\\) subshell, which contains up to \\(10\\) electrons, has five orbitals.\r\n\tAn \\(f\\) subshell, which contains up to \\(14\\) electrons, has seven orbitals.\r\n\r\nYou can see that the number of orbitals is half of the number of maximum electrons.\r\nOrbitals have distinct shapes. For example, \\(s\\) orbitals are spherical and \\(p\\) orbitals are dumbbell-shaped. Orbitals within the same subshell that have the same shape are generally of equal energy but have a different orientation in space, such as \\(p_{x}\\), \\(p_{y}\\) and \\(p_{z}\\), where \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) denote the orientation in space.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike shells and subshells, electron fill orbitals from lowest to highest energy level. This is called the Aufbau principle. Electrons also fill orbitals of a subshell such that each orbital acquires one electron before any orbital acquires a second electron. All single electrons must have the same spin.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElectron configurations\r\nElectron configurations show how the electrons are distributed within an atom. They are written from lowest energy subshell to the highest energy subshell. Each subshell is written with the number of electrons in each subshell shown as a superscript. The superscripts in an electron configuration will add up to the total number of electrons for that atom. \r\nFull electron configurations\r\nFull electron configurations show the location of all electrons in an atom. The full electron configurations of the first 10 elements are shown in the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElement\r\nAtomic number\r\nElectron configuration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{H}\\)\r\n\\(1\\)\r\n\\(1s^{1}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{He}\\)\r\n\\(2\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{Li}\\)\r\n\\(3\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{1}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{Be}\\)\r\n\\(4\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{B}\\)\r\n\\(5\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}2p^{1}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{C}\\)\r\n\\(6\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}2p^{2}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{N}\\)\r\n\\(7\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}2p^{3}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{O}\\)\r\n\\(8\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}2p^{4}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{F}\\)\r\n\\(9\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}2p^{5}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\ce{Ne}\\)\r\n\\(10\\)\r\n\\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}2p^{6}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCondensed electron configuration\r\nCondensed electron configurations are a short way of showing electron configurations. They are often also called noble gas configurations and are handy to avoid writing out all of the subshells. This way of representing electron configurations states the previous noble gas in square brackets, followed by the remaining electrons.\r\nFor example, let's look at the magnesium atom, which has a full electron configuration of \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}\\). The previous noble gas, as shown on the periodic table, is neon. Neon has an electron configuration of \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\). You can see that the location of the first 10 electrons is the same as in magnesium, so we can replace this part of the electron configuration with the chemical symbol for the noble gas in square brackets: \\(\\textrm{[Ne]}\\). This makes the condensed electron configuration for magnesium: \\(\\textrm{[Ne]}\\,3s^{2}\\).\r\n\r\nOrbital diagrams\r\nOrbital diagrams depict spin of individual electrons within each subshell. The orbital diagrams for the first 10 elements are also shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorked example \u2013 writing full electron configurations\r\nWrite the full electron configuration for \\(\\ce{Na}\\).\r\nStep 1: Determine the number of electrons. This is the same as the atomic number (Z).\r\n\\[Z=11\\]\r\nTherefore, \\(\\ce{Na}\\) has \\(11\\textrm{ electrons}\\).\r\nStep 2: Place the electrons into orbitals according to the Aufbau principle. The first two electrons go into the \\(1s\\) orbital as a pair. The next two electrons are placed in the \\(2s\\) orbital. The next six electrons are placed in \\(2p\\) orbitals as three pairs. The remaining electron is placed in \\(3s\\) orbital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 3: Convert the orbital diagram into an electron configuration, listing the subshells in order of increasing energy. Write the total number of electrons in each subshell as a superscript.\r\n\\(\\ce{Na}\\) has the full electron configuration \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{1}\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorked example \u2013 writing condensed electron configurations\r\nWrite the condensed electron configuration for \\(\\ce{Ca}\\).\r\nStep 1: Use the steps in Worked example \u2013 writing full electron configurations to write the full electron configuration for \\(\\ce{Ca}\\).\r\n\\(\\ce{Ca}\\) has the full electron configuration \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}\\,3p^{6}\\,4s^{2}\\).\r\nStep 2: Determine the full electron configuration of the previous noble gas, according to the periodic table. For \\(\\ce{Ca}\\), the previous noble gas is \\(\\ce{Ar}\\).\r\n\\(\\ce{Ar}\\) has the full electron configuration \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}\\,3p^{6}\\).\r\nStep 3: Write the condensed electron configuration by replacing the electron configuration of \\(\\ce{Ar}\\) within the electron configuration of \\(\\ce{Ca}\\) with \\(\\textrm{[Ar]}\\).\r\n\\(\\ce{Ca}\\) has the condensed

They play a crucial role in many aspects of science and technology. Bohr planetary (particle) model and Schr\u00f6dinger's wave mechanical model Electrons have historically been described as tiny particles that revolve around the nucleus in circular orbits similar to the solar system. This is Bohr's particle model. However, this model overly simplifies the path of electrons within atoms and was eventually rejected. The modern understanding of electron behaviour is based on Schr\u00f6dinger's wave mechanical model. The wave model shows that electrons don't have exact paths.

Metals are located on the left side of the periodic table, and non-metals are located on the right. Elements know as metalloids exhibit both metallic and non-metallic properties.

Thus, the electrons in the outermost shell (largest and highest-energy) are known as valence electrons. Valence electrons are accessible to other chemical species. This allows them to participate in chemical reactions. Elements in the same group have the same number of valence electrons.\r\nThe rest of the electrons in the atom are known as core electrons. Core electrons are tightly bound to the nucleus and are considered inaccessible.\r\nAll of the elements in the table below have one \\(s\\) electron in their outermost electron shell.

The \\(s\\)- block contains elements that have their last electron in \\(s\\) subshell. Similarly, \\(p\\)-, \\(d\\)-, and \\(f\\)-blocks have elements with their last electron located in \\(p\\), \\(d\\), and \\(f\\) subshells, respectively.

For groups \\(12-18\\), subtract \\(10\\) out of the group number to get the number of valence electrons.

Ionic bonding explains how these substances form. Understanding ionic bonds helps us see how different materials are made and why they have certain properties.\r\nWhen forming bonds, atoms attempt to achieve a stable noble gas configuration by sharing, losing or gaining electrons for each of the atoms associated. In the case of ionic bonds, atoms lose or gain electrons to form ions, which then form electrostatic interactions.\r\n\r\nIons\r\nIons are charged species formed when electrons are transferred from one atom to another. The charge of an ion depends on:\r\n\r\n\twhether the atom gains electrons to form negatively-charged ions (or anions), or loses electrons to form positively-charged ions (or cations)\r\n\tthe number of electrons gained or lost.\r\n\r\nFor example, \\(\\ce{Na}^{+}\\) is an \\(\\ce{Na}\\) atom that has lost one electron. \\(\\ce{O}^{2-}\\) is an \\(\\ce{O}\\) atom that has gained two electrons.\r\n\r\nMonatomic ions\r\nMonatomic (or monoatomic) ions are ions consisting of a single atom. Ions formed from main group elements are named using the name of the element, followed by the word \"ion\". The chemical symbol for monatomic ions is written using the chemical symbol for the element, with the charge of the ion written afterwards as a superscript. For instance, the lithium ion is written as \\(\\ce{Li}^{+}\\), the magnesium ion is \\(\\ce{Mg}^{2+}\\) and the aluminium ion is \\(\\ce{Al}^{3+}\\).\r\n\r\nTransition metals (\\(d\\)-block and \\(f\\)-block) and some \\(p\\)-block elements can form multiple cations such as \\(\\ce{Cu}^{+}\\) and \\(\\ce{Cu}^{2+}\\), and \\(\\ce{Pb}^{2+}\\) and \\(\\ce{Pb}^{4+}\\). When naming these ions, the ion with the smaller charge is written with an \"\u2013ous\" suffix, and the larger charge is written with an \"\u2013ic\". For example, copper would form the cuprous ion (\\(\\ce{Cu}^{+}\\)) and the cupric ion (\\(\\ce{Cu}^{2+}\\)). The charge of the ion can also be written in Roman numerals within parenthesis next to the element name. For example, \\(\\ce{Cu}^{+}\\) is copper(I) ion, and \\(\\ce{Cu}^{2+}\\) is copper(II). There is no space between the element name and the parenthesis.\r\n\r\nAnions are named by removing the ending of the element name and replacing it with \"\u2013ide\". Let's consider the anion formed when chlorine (\\(\\ce{Cl}\\)) gains an electron. The anion formed would be the chloride ion (\\(\\ce{Cl}^{-}\\)).\r\n\r\nPolyatomic ions\r\nPolyatomic ions consist of more than one atom. Some example are the \\(\\ce{SO}_{4}^{2-}\\) (sulfate), \\(\\ce{NO}_{3}^{-}\\) (nitrate), \\(\\ce{PO}_{4}^{3-}\\) (phosphate) and \\(\\ce{NH}_{4}^{+}\\) (ammonium) ions. Atoms in polyatomic ions are held together by covalent bonds.\r\n\r\nThe octet rule\r\nThe valence electron configuration of noble gases is considered the most stable. Except for helium, all noble gases have eight electrons in their valence shell (completely filled \\(s\\) and \\(p\\) subshells). Main group elements gain or lose electrons to achieve a full outer valence shell containing eight electrons. This is the octet rule. \r\nThe main group metals attempt to achieve the electron configuration of the noble gas just before them in the periodic table by losing electrons. For instance, potassium's electron configuration is \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}\\,3p^{6}\\,4s^{1}\\). the potassium atom will lose one \\(4s\\) electron to become a  potassium cation (\\(\\ce{K}^{+}\\)) to achieve a noble gas electron configuration: \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}\\,3p^{6}\\). This is the same as the electron configuration for argon.\r\nMain group non-metals acquire the electron configuration of the noble gas just after them in the periodic table by gaining electrons. Consider the electron configuration of chlorine: \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}\\,3p^{5}\\). To achieve a noble gas electron configuration, the chlorine atom gains one \\(3p\\) electron to become a chloride anion (\\(\\ce{Cl}^{-}\\)). The electron configuration for the chloride ion is \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}\\,3p^{6}\\), which is also the same as the electron configuration of argon.\r\nIn general, metals form cations and non-metals form anions.\r\nExceptions to the octet rule\r\nIn some molecules, atoms do not follow the octet rule. Atoms such as sulfur, phosphorus and chlorine can deviate from the octet rule by forming molecules in which there are more than eight electrons in the valence shell. This is due to the availability of a vacant \\(d\\) orbital in the third shell.\r\n\r\nIonic compounds\r\nIonic compounds are held together by electrostatic interactions between cations and anions involved. The cations and anions are arranged in such a way that gaps between ions are filled efficiently and permit maximum electrostatic interactions. Ionic compounds are polar materials.\r\n\r\nFormation of ionic compounds\r\nIonic bonds forms between metals and non-metals through the transfer of electrons from metals to non-metals. Metals provide the cation (by losing electrons), and non-metals provide the anion (by gaining electrons). \r\n\r\nPlay animationStop animation\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally, chemical bonds formed between atoms with larger electronegativity (e.g. elements in groups 16 and 17 of the periodic table) and smaller electronegativity (e.g. elements in groups 1 and 2 of the periodic table) are considered ionic. As an example, \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\) consists of \\(\\ce{Na}\\) which has an electronegativity value of \\(0.93\\) and \\(\\ce{Cl}\\) which has an electronegativity of 3.16. The difference between these values is \\(2.23\\).\r\nFor an ionic compound to be formed, the difference between electronegativities of two participating atoms must be larger than or equal to \\(2\\). This permits strong electrostatic interactions between the electrons of one atom and the nucleus of the other atom.\r\n\r\nWriting chemical formulas for ionic compounds\r\nIonic compounds are neutral species. Ions involved in an ionic compound combine in such a ratio that the net charge becomes zero. The ratio of ions in an ionic compound can be represented using a chemical formula, using subscripts after each chemical symbol. This displays the lowest possible ratio in which ions can combine to form the compound. Examples are \\(\\ce{MgO}\\) and \\(\\ce{CaCl2}\\).\r\nParentheses are used to enclose polyatomic ions when more than one polyatomic ion is involved in an ionic compound. In this case, the subscript is written outside the parentheses. Examples are \\(\\ce{Fe2(SO4)3}\\) and \\(\\ce{(NH4)2CO3}\\).\r\n\r\nNaming ionic compounds\r\nIonic compounds can be named by following some easy steps. Let's look at how we can name the compound \\(\\ce{CaCl2}\\).\r\n\r\n \tName the cation by writing the name of the metal element. The cation in \\(\\ce{CaCl2}\\) would simply be \"calcium\".\r\n\tName the anion by writing the name of the non-metal element. Remove the ending of the element name and replacing it with \"\u2013ide\". The anion in \\(\\ce{CaCl2}\\) would be \"chloride\".\r\n\r\nTransitional metals and some of the \\(p\\) block elements have more than one charge. Therefore, if the cation is from those groups, you must include the charge within parentheses next to its name in Roman numerals or use \"\u2013ous\" and \"\u2013ic\" to indicate smaller charge and larger charge, respectively. For instance, \\(\\ce{CuCl}\\) is written as copper(I) chloride or cuprous chloride, \\(\\ce{CuCl2}\\) is written as copper(II) chloride or cupric chloride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical properties of ionic compounds\r\nIonic compounds exhibit a range of distinctive properties that make them essential in various applications. The table below lists some properties of ionic compounds and examples of how the properties are applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProperty\r\nExample application\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDurable and beautiful as crystalline solids\r\nPotassium aluminium sulfate is used in traditional bookbinding to increase the toughness and lustre of decorative paste papers.\r\n\r\n\r\nConduct electricity in solution\r\nLithium salts in lithium\u2013ion batteries are used to conduct electricity by facilitating the flow of charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh melting and boiling points\r\nMagnesium oxide is used in furnace linings because it can withstand extreme temperatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoluble in polar solvents\r\nPotassium chloride is a medication used in the management and treatment of hypokalemia. Its solubility in bodily fluids allows it to be absorbed more effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorked example \u2013 determining the number of electrons gained or lost\r\nDetermine how many electrons an aluminium atom has to lose or gain to obtain a noble gas electron configuration.\r\nStep 1: Write the electron configuration for aluminium.\r\n\t\\[1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}\\,3p^{1}\\]\r\nStep 2: Identify the nearest noble gas. Write its electron configuration.\r\n\tThe nearest noble gas is \\(\\ce{Ne}\\), which has an electron configuration of \\(1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\).\r\nStep 3: The purpose of losing or gaining an electron is to acquire an octet in the valence shell. Identify the number of electrons in the valence shell and deduce whether aluminium will gain or lose electrons to achieve an octet.\r\n\tThe valence shell contains three electrons: two in the \\(3s\\) orbital and one in the \\(3p\\) orbital. It can gain the electron configuration of \\(\\ce{Ne}\\) by losing these three electrons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorked example \u2013 writing chemical formulas\r\nDetermine the chemical formula of the compound produced when \\(\\ce{Ca}^{2+}\\) and \\(\\ce{F}^{-}\\) ions become electrostatically attracted.\r\nStep 1: Write the symbol of the cation with its charge, followed by the anion with its charge.\r\n\t\\[\\ce{Ca}^{2+}\\ce{F}^{-}\\]\r\nStep 2: Cross each ion's charge (only the numerical value, not the sign) and write it down as subscripts. The calcium ion's charge will be written next to fluoride ion, and the fluoride ion's charge will be written next to calcium ion, both as subscripts. Where the subscript is a \\(1\\), simply exclude it.\r\n\t\\(\\ce{Ca}_{1}\\ce{F}_{2}\\), which becomes \\(\\ce{CaF2}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nYour turn \u2013 ionic bonding\r\nUnderstanding ionic bonding is essential for grasping how elements interact to form compounds with unique properties.

These trends, observed across periods and groups, provide insights into the behaviour of elements and their interactions with others.\r\nSome key trends emerge from the periodic table, including how atomic size (atomic radii) changes across periods and down groups, how much energy is required to remove the first electron from the valence shell (first ionisation energy), how readily an atom can accept an electron (electron affinity), and how strongly atoms attract electrons in chemical bonds (electronegativity).\r\n\r\nAtomic radii\r\nAtomic radii (or radius) increases down a group (from top to bottom) of the periodic table. As \\(n\\) increases when moving down a group, the number of electron shells become larger; the electron orbitals are therefore larger, leading to an increase in atomic radii.\r\nWhen moving across a period (from left to right), atomic radii decreases. As you move across a period, each successive element has an additional proton in the nucleus and an additional electron in the same valence shell. The increase in positive charge in the nucleus attracts the electrons more strongly, pulling them closer to the nucleus. Although the number of electrons increases, these electrons are added to the same energy level and do not significantly increase electron\u2013electron repulsion that would otherwise counteract the pull of the nucleus.\r\nThis stronger attraction between the increased positive charge of the nucleus and the electrons results in a smaller atomic radii as you move across a period.\r\nAn exception to the trend in atomic radii across a period is in the transition metals. As you move across the transition metals (\\(d\\)-block elements), the decrease in atomic radii is less pronounced. This means that elements in the same period within the \\(d\\)-block will have a similar atomic radii.\r\n\r\nFirst ionisation energy\r\nThe first ionisation energy is the minimum energy required to remove the first electron from a neutral atom. The second and third ionisation energies are the energies necessary to remove the second and third electrons from the atom, respectively.\r\nFirst ionisation energy increases when moving across a period as the attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons increases. More energy is therefore required to overcome this strong attraction and remove the first valence electron.\r\nWhen moving down a group, the first ionisation energy decreases. This is because a valence electron in a higher energy level (greater \\(n\\)) is easier to remove.\r\n\r\nElectron affinity\r\nElectron affinity gives an indication of how easy it is for a neutral atom to accept an electron and form a negatively-charged ion (an anion). Quantitatively, it is the amount of energy released when an electron is added to an atom in the gaseous phase to form an anion. \r\nThe electron affinity increases when moving across a period. The interaction between the nucleus and the electrons increases, and more energy is released when an electron is added. Non-metals, particularly the halogens, have high electron affinities because they are close to achieving a full valence shell, making it easier for them to gain electrons.\r\n\r\n\r\nElectronegativity\r\nElectronegativity is the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons from another atom to form chemical bonds. The larger the value, the larger the electron-attracting ability.\r\nElectronegativity decreases from top to bottom and increases from left to right of the periodic table. Across a period, atoms have more protons and a higher effective nuclear charge as you move across a period, which increases the attraction for electrons. Down a group, the atomic radii increases and the addition of electron shells leads to a greater distance between the nucleus and the valence electrons, and a reduced attraction for electrons.\r\nNoble gases are generally not considered in electronegativity trends because they have full valence electron shells and are typically inert. They do not tend to form chemical bonds, so electronegativity is not so relevant\u2014although, some heavier noble gases like xenon can form chemical bonds under specific conditions. This means that fluorine is generally considered the most electronegative element.\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: Periodic table data comes from Periodic-Table-JSON, Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0).\r\n\r\n\r\nWorked example \u2013 predicting periodic trends\r\nPredict which atom is larger for the following pairs of atoms:\r\n\r\n\t\\(\\ce{C}\\) and \\(\\ce{F}\\)\r\n\t\\(\\ce{Na}\\) and \\(\\ce{Cs}\\)\r\n\t\\(\\ce{Sc}\\) and \\(\\ce{Ni}\\)\r\n\r\nStep 1: Recall the trend in atomic radii in the periodic table.\r\nWhen moving across a period (left to right), atomic radii decreases. As you move across a period, the number of valence increases, making the electron cloud more negative. However, the number of protons (atomic number) also increases, making the nucleus more positive. This allows the positively-charged nucleus to pull the electrons in closer, decreasing the atomic radius.\r\nWhen moving down a group (top to bottom), atomic radii increases. Going down a group, elements gain an electron shell. As there will be a greater distance between the valence electrons and the nucleus, the atomic radius increases.\r\nStep 2: Locate the elements on the periodic table and compare them.\r\n\r\n\t\\(\\ce{C}\\) and \\(\\ce{F}\\) are both located in period \\(2\\), but \\(\\ce{F}\\) is located further right in group \\(17\\) compared to \\(\\ce{C}\\) in group \\(14\\).\r\n\t\\(\\ce{Na}\\) and \\(\\ce{Cs}\\) are both located in group \\(1\\), but \\(\\ce{Cs}\\) is located further down in period \\(6\\) compared to \\(\\ce{Na}\\) in period \\(3\\).\r\n\t\\(\\ce{Sc}\\) and \\(\\ce{Ni}\\) are both located in period \\(4\\), but \\(\\ce{Ni}\\) is located further right in group \\(10\\) compared to \\(\\ce{Sc}\\) in group \\(3\\).\r\n\r\nStep 3: Apply your understanding of the relative locations of the elements on the periodic table with the trend in atomic radii to predict which atom is larger.\r\n\r\n\t\\(\\ce{C}\\) would be expected to have a bigger atomic radius than \\(\\ce{F}\\) and would therefore be larger.\r\n\t\\(\\ce{Cs}\\) would be expected to have a bigger atomic radius than \\(\\ce{Na}\\) and would therefore be larger.\r\n\t\\(\\ce{Sc}\\) would be expected to have a bigger atomic radius than \\(\\ce{Ni}\\) and would therefore be larger.

This is a short movie on substitution in algebra. Replacing a pro-numeral or variable or letter in an expression or formula with a number is called substitution. Instance, here\u2019s an expression, three P, and we want to work this out, in other words evaluate, if P equals minus five. So substituting P equals minus five into the expression, three P is the same as three times P, which is three times minus five which is minus 15.\r\n\r\nHere are two more examples. Evaluate A plus five over B, if A equals minus nine and B equals two, here you notice we have two pro-numerals A and B, so substituting A and B into the formula or, sorry, into the expression, we have minus nine plus five over two which gives us minus four over two which is minus two.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s another one. We want to evaluate W squared minus two Z, if W equals minus one and Z equals five, so substituting into the expression we have minus one all squared minus two times five which gives us one minus one times minus one is one minus 10 is minus 9.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s look at a more complicated expression. Here we have the formula C equals five brackets F minus 32 close brackets over nine and that\u2019s the formula that converts a temperature in Fahrenheit into one in Centigrade, so here we want to convert a temperature of 100 degrees in Fahrenheit, so substituting F equals 100 into the formula we get 37.78 degrees Celsius, so again, as with the previous examples, we\u2019re just substituting the unknown, or the pro-numeral, which in this case is F, into the formula.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Find out how to replace pronumerals with numbers in a formula to get a numerical value for some quantity.

Quadratics frequently arise in mathematics, science and engineering. Let's factorise a quadratic into two linear factors using the \"completing the square\" method. This is a general method that allows any quadratic to be factorised. For example \\[x^2+8x-5 = \\left(x+4-\\sqrt{21}\\right)\\left(x+4+\\sqrt{21}\\right).\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA perfect square is of the form: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x+b\\right)^{2} &amp; =x^{2}+2bx+b^{2}. &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x-b\\right)^{2} &amp; =x^{2}-2bx+b^{2}. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nConsider, the expression \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+2bx. \\end{align*}\\] To make this a perfect square, according to eqn \\(\\left(1\\right),\\) you have to add \\(b^{2}\\). But if you add \\(b^{2}\\) you must also take it away to preserve equality. That is, given \\(x^{2}+2bx\\) we can write: \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+2bx &amp; =x^{2}+2bx+b^{2}-b^{2}. &amp; \\left(3\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nNote that the amount we added and subtracted is one half of the \\(x\\) coefficient squared. That is,\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\left(\\frac{2b}{2}\\right)^{2} &amp; =b^{2}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nIf you look at the right hand side of eqn \\(\\left(3\\right)\\)we have added \\(b^{2}-b^{2}=0\\) so the value is unchanged. However we can now group the terms to get:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+2bx &amp; =\\left(x^{2}+2bx+b^{2}\\right)-b^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Using eqn \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) above the term in brackets on the right hand side is \\(\\left(x+b\\right)^{2}\\)and so using the difference of two squares formula (DOTS) 1 The difference of two squares formula states that \\[\\begin{align*} a^{2}-b^{2} &amp; =\\left(a+b\\right)\\left(a-b\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left(a-b\\right)\\left(a+b\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Note that the order of the factors on the right hand side does not matter.  \\[\\begin{align*} x^{2}+2bx &amp; =\\left(x+b\\right)^{2}-b^{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\left(x+b-b\\right)\\left(x+b+b\\right)\\\\ &amp; =x\\left(x+2b\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nAt first this might seem like a lot of work for very little gain.

In order to do this we follow the above procedure and the results are magical! The following examples illustrate this.\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nFactorise \\(x^{2}+8x-5\\) by completing the square.\r\nSolution\r\nWe take half of the \\(x\\) coefficient and square it.

We cannot apply the DOTS rule because we have the SUM of two squares not the DIFFERENCE. So in this case the quadratic \\(x^{2}+5x+9\\) does not have any real factors and solutions. Complex factors and solutions do exist but are not considered in this module.2 Geometrically this means that the graph of \\(x^{2}+5x+9\\) does not intersect the \\(x-\\) axis. The graph is shown below\r\n\r\n\r\nSee Exercise 1 below.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompleting the square when the coefficient of \\(x^{2}\\) is not one\r\nIn this section we consider the completing the square method on quadratics of the form \\(ax^{2}+bx+c\\) where \\(a\\neq1.\\) In this case we simply divide the quadratic by \\(a\\) and proceed as above. That is we write\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx+c &amp; =a\\left[x^{2}+\\frac{b}{a}x+\\frac{c}{a}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] and complete the square on the RHS term in the square brackets. Don\u2019t forget to include the \\(a\\) in the final result!\r\n\r\nExample 4\r\nFactorise \\(2x^{2}-10x+2\\).\r\nSolution\r\nDivide the quadratic by \\(2\\) and write \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{2}-10x+2 &amp; =2\\left[x^{2}-\\frac{10}{2}x+\\frac{2}{2}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[x^{2}-5x+1\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Now complete the square on the quadratic in square brackets on the RHS, \\[\\begin{align*} 2x^{2}-10x+2 &amp; =2\\left[x^{2}-5x+1+\\left(\\frac{-5}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{-5}{2}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\quad\\text{(add the square of half the $x\\text{ coefficient and subtract it)}$ }\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[x^{2}-5x+1+\\frac{25}{4}-\\frac{25}{4}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[x^{2}-5x+\\frac{25}{4}+1-\\frac{25}{4}\\right]\\ (\\text{regrouping the terms on the RHS)}\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}+1-\\frac{25}{4}\\right]\\ \\text{using eqn $\\left(1\\right)$ }\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{21}{4}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =2\\left[\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right)\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right)\\right]\\ \\text{using DOTS rule}\\\\ &amp; =2\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right)\\left(x-\\frac{5}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right). \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSee Exercise 2 below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompleting the square and the quadratic formula\r\nThis section is beyond the intent of this module and may be skipped if you are not interested.\r\n\r\nYou may be aware of the quadratic formula. It gives the solutions of the quadratic equation: \\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx+c &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(4\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and is usually written as \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}. \\end{align*}\\] The quadratic formula is established by completing the square on eqn \\(\\left(4\\right)\\).

This is another factorisation movie. This one is on completing the square.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s first look at X plus B all squared, which is the same as X squared plus two B X plus B squared, or putting it around the other way, X squared plus two B X plus B squared is the same as X plus B all squared. Notice the term B is half of the co\u2011efficient of X, the middle term. In other words X plus B all squared is called a perfect square. So as an example, X squared minus 24 X plus 144, look at the middle term which is minus 24 X, half of that is minus 12 and thus that is our perfect square. So knowing how to find a perfect square is very important when completing the square.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s do an example. Factorise X squared plus eight X minus nine. Step one, half the co-efficient of X, in other words half of eight is four, then we square the result, four squared is 16. Step three, add and subtract 16, in other words X square plus eight X plus 16 is our perfect square, then we subtract the 16 minus nine, notice that expression there is the same as the original expression, eight square plus eight X minus nine. Step four, complete the square and simplify. In other words eight square plus eight X plus 16 is X plus four all squared minus 16 minus nine is minus 25 and then finally factorise using the difference of two squares, which is X plus four plus five brackets X plus four minus five, which is the same as X plus four X minus one.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s do another one. X squared minus six X minus four. Step one, half the co\u2011efficient of X which is half of six is three, square the result, three squared is nine. Step three, add and subtract nine, that gives us X squared minus six X plus nine, there\u2019s our perfect square, then we have to subtract nine to make sure that we have the original X squared minus six X minus four. Step four, complete the square and simplify, in other words, X squared minus six X plus nine is X minus three all squared minus nine minus four is minus 13 and then finally factorise using the difference of two squares, which is X minus three plus root 13, X minus three minus root 13.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at a slightly harder problem. Notice here we\u2019re factorising two X squared minus 10 X plus two. We can only complete the square if the co-efficient of X squared is one, so the first step we have to do is to remove the factor of two, thus we have two brackets X squared minus five X plus one. Now we go through the same process as before, half the co-efficient of X, but here the co-efficient of X is now five, so that half of that is five over two, square the result, five over two squared is 25 over four, then we add and subtract 25 over four which gives us that expression. Continuing on from the previous slide we have that expression, now we need to take the difference of two squares which gives us two brackets X minus five over two all squared minus 21 over four, but that can be simplified into the final expression two brackets X minus five over two plus root 21 over two brackets X minus five over two minus root 21 over two.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself. The answers to these problems are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Quadratic expressions have the general form \\[ax^2+bx+c\\] where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are real numbers and \\(a\\neq 0\\).

For example, the equation \\[\\begin{align*} 3\\left(2x-7\\right) &amp; =-15 \\end{align*}\\] may be transposed to get \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =6. \\end{align*}\\] Transposition involves changing the equation via operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. This module discusses techniques for solving linear equations by transposition.\r\n\r\nSimple equations\r\nThe essential point is that in solving an equation, what you do to one side must be done to the other side.\r\n\r\nIf you add, subtract, multiply or divide one side of the equation by a number you must do the same to the other side. This preserves equality.\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nSolve \\(m+4=-2\\).\r\n\r\nSolution: We want to make \\(m\\) the subject of the equation.\\[\\begin{align*} m+4 &amp; =-2. \\end{align*}\\] 1 When a variable is the only term on one side of the equal sign we call it the subject. For example the formula for the area of a circle is \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\pi r^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] In this case the variable \\(A\\) is the subject.  To get \\(m\\) on its own we need to take \\(4\\) from both sides to get: \\[\\begin{align*} m+4-4 &amp; =-2-4\\\\ m &amp; =-6. \\end{align*}\\] 2 Remember that what you do to one side of an equation must be done to the other side to preserve equality. The solution is \\(m=4.\\) Note that you can always check your solution by substituting your answer into the original equation. In this case \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =m+4\\\\ &amp; =-6+4\\\\ &amp; =-2\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS} \\end{align*}\\] and so our solution is correct.3 LHS and RHS are abbreviations for left hand side and right hand side respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nSolve \\(p-2=5\\).\r\n\r\nSolution: We want to make \\(p\\) the subject.

As you become more experienced, you may perform several operations in one step.\r\n \tIf the variable appears in terms on both sides of the equation, you need to get these terms to one side of the equation and then solve for the variable.\r\n \tIf an equation involves brackets, the brackets should be expanded first.\r\n \tIf an equation involves fractions, you need to use a common denominator.\r\n\r\nThese ideas are illustrated in the following examples. Note that the strategy in the examples below is not part of the solution. It is the basic plan to solve the equation. You do NOT need to provide a strategy when solving problems. Nor do you need to describe each step. The strategy and description of each step is used below to show you the thinking that leads to the solution and the steps involved.\r\n\r\nExample 5\r\nSolve \\(2w-3=-17.\\)\r\n\r\nStrategy: We want to make \\(w\\) the subject. We do this in two steps. First we get \\(2w\\) on its own then divide by two to get \\(w\\) as the subject. That is we add \\(3\\) to both sides and then divide both sides by \\(2\\).\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} 2w-3 &amp; =-17\\\\ 2w-3+3 &amp; =-17+3\\\\ 2w &amp; =-14\\\\ \\frac{2w}{2} &amp; =-\\frac{14}{2}\\\\ w &amp; =-7. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(w=-7.\\) With more complex equations, it is a good idea to check your result. However, this is not necessary unless you are asked to check. In this example, \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =2w-3\\\\ &amp; =2\\times\\left(-7\\right)-3\\\\ &amp; =-14-3\\\\ &amp; =-17\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS } \\end{align*}\\] and so our solution is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 6\r\nSolve: \\(\\frac{3d}{4}+5=7.\\)\r\n\r\nStrategy: First get the term involving \\(d\\) on its own by subtracting five from both sides, then solve for \\(d.\\)\r\n\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{3d}{4}+5 &amp; =7\\\\ \\frac{3d}{4}+5-5 &amp; =7-5\\quad\\text{(subtract $5\\text{ from both sides)}$ }\\\\ \\frac{3d}{4} &amp; =2\\\\ \\frac{3d}{4}\\times4 &amp; =2\\times4\\quad\\text{(multiply both sides by $4$ )}\\\\ 3d &amp; =8\\\\ \\frac{3d}{3} &amp; =\\frac{8}{3}\\quad\\text{(divide both sides by $3)$ }\\\\ d &amp; =\\frac{8}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] Solution is \\(d=8\/3.\\)\r\n\r\nWe can check the solution (but this is not necessary) as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =\\frac{3d}{4}+5\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{4}\\times\\frac{8}{3}+5\\\\ &amp; =2+5\\\\ &amp; =7\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS } \\end{align*}\\] so our solution is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 7: Variable on both sides\r\nSolve \\(3c+1=c-5\\).\r\n\r\nStrategy: First get all the \\(c\\) terms on one side then solve for \\(c\\).\r\n\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} 3c+1 &amp; =c-5\\\\ 3c-c+1 &amp; =c-c-5\\quad\\text{(subtract $c$ from both sides to get $c$ terms to one side)}\\\\ 2c+1 &amp; =-5\\\\ 2c+1-1 &amp; =-5-1\\quad\\text{(subtract $1$ from both sides)}\\\\ 2c &amp; =-6\\\\ c &amp; =-3\\quad\\text{(divide both sides by $2$ )}. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(c=-3.\\)\r\n\r\nCheck (not required) \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =3c+1\\\\ &amp; =3\\left(-3\\right)+1\\\\ &amp; =-8.\\\\ \\text{RHS} &amp; =c-5\\\\ &amp; =-3-5\\\\ &amp; =-8\\\\ &amp; =\\text{LHS } \\end{align*}\\] so our solution is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 8: Brackets\r\nSolve \\(3(5-2j)=33.\\)\r\n\r\nStrategy: First remove brackets and solve using the techniques shown above.\r\n\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} 3(5-2j) &amp; =33\\\\ 15-6j &amp; =33\\quad\\text{ (remove brackets) }\\\\ -6j &amp; =33-15\\quad\\text{(subract $15$ from both sides)}\\\\ &amp; =18\\\\ j &amp; =\\frac{18}{-6}\\quad\\text{(divide both sides by $-6$ )}\\\\ &amp; =-3. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(j=-3.\\)\r\n\r\nCheck (not required) \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =3(5-2j)\\\\ &amp; =15-6\\left(-3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =15+18\\\\ &amp; =33\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS} \\end{align*}\\] so our solution is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 9: Brackets and variable on both sides\r\nSolve \\(2(3k-2)=5\\left(k+7\\right).\\)\r\n\r\nStrategy: Remove brackets, get the variable on one side and then solve using the techniques shown above.\r\n\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} 2(3k-2) &amp; =5\\left(k+7\\right)\\\\ 6k-4 &amp; =5k+35\\\\ 6k-5k-4 &amp; =35\\\\ k-4 &amp; =35\\\\ k &amp; =35+4\\\\ &amp; =39.\\\\ \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(k=39\\).\r\n\r\nCheck (not required)\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\text{LHS} &amp; =2\\left(3k-2\\right)\\\\ &amp; =6k-4\\\\ &amp; =6\\times39-4\\\\ &amp; =230.\\\\ \\text{RHS} &amp; =5\\left(k+7\\right)\\\\ &amp; =5\\left(39+7\\right)\\\\ &amp; =5\\times46\\\\ &amp; =230\\\\ &amp; =\\text{RHS } \\end{align*}\\] so our solution is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 10: Fractions\r\nSolve \\(\\frac{h+1}{3}=\\frac{h}{4}\\).\r\n\r\nStrategy: Multiply both sides of the equation by a common denominator and solve using the techniques shown above.

When a number such as 16 is written in the form 42\u202f(which means 4 x 4) we say that it is written as an exponential, or in index notation.\r\nThere are laws about multiplying and dividing indices as well as how to deal with negative indices.\r\n\r\nThis module introduces rules for multiplying and dividing expressions using index notation. For example how to simplify expressions like \\(4a^{3}b\\times3ab^{5}\\) or \\(9a^{3}b^{2}c\\div3ab^{5}\\). We do not consider fractional indices which are covered in a different module. The plural of index is indices.\r\n\r\nHere's a video showing how the rules work:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex notation\r\nConsider the following examples:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} 3^{4} &amp; =3\\times3\\times3\\times3=81\\\\ 5^{3} &amp; =5\\times5\\times5=125\\\\ 2^{7} &amp; =2\\times2\\times2\\times2\\times2\\times2\\times2=128 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nIn general: \\[ a^{n}=\\underbrace{a\\times a\\times a\\times\\ldots\\times a}_{n\\textrm{ factors}} \\] The letter \\(n\\) in \\(a^{n}\\) is referred to in one of three ways:\r\n\r\n \t\\(n\\) is the index in \\(a^{n}\\) with \\(a\\) known as the base.\r\n \t\\(n\\) is the exponent or power to which the base \\(a\\) is raised.\r\n \t\\(n\\) is the logarithm, with \\(a\\) as the base. (see the Logarithms module)\r\n\r\nWhen a number such as \\(125\\) is written in the form \\(5^{3}\\) we say it is written as an exponential or in index notation. Multiplication and division of numbers or expressions written in index notation is achieved using index laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex laws\r\nThis section states and gives examples of universal index laws.\r\n\r\nFirst Index Law\r\nTo multiply index expressions you add the indices. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} 2^{3}\\times2^{2} &amp; =\\left(2\\times2\\times2\\right)\\times\\left(2\\times2\\right)\\\\ &amp; =2\\times2\\times2\\times2\\times2\\\\ &amp; =2^{5} \\end{align*}\\] Therefore \\(2^{3}\\times2^{2}=2^{3+2}=2^{5}\\). In general:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Index Law: \\[ a^{m}\\times a^{n}=a^{m+n} \\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond Index Law\r\nTo divide expressions subtract the indices. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} 3^{5}\\div3^{3} &amp; =\\frac{3^{5}}{3^{3}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3\\times3\\times3\\times3\\times3}{3\\times3\\times3}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3\\times3}{1}\\quad\\textrm{cancelling three lots of 3}\\\\ &amp; =3^{2} \\end{align*}\\] Therefore \\(3^{5}\\div3^{3}=\\frac{3^{5}}{3^{3}}=3^{5-3}=3^{2}.\\) In general:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond Index Law: \\[ a^{m}\\div a^{n}=\\frac{a^{m}}{a^{n}}=a^{m-n},\\quad a\\neq0 \\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that expressions in index form can only be multiplied or divided if they have the same base.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThird Index Law\r\nTo raise an expression in index form to a power, multiply the indices. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(5^{2}\\right)^{3} &amp; =5^{2}\\times5^{2}\\times5^{2}\\\\ &amp; =5^{2+2+2}\\quad\\textrm{using the first index law}\\\\ &amp; =5^{6} \\end{align*}\\] Therefore \\(\\left(5^{2}\\right)^{3}=5^{2\\times3}=5^{6}.\\) In general:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThird Index Law: \\[ \\left(a^{m}\\right)^{n}=a^{m\\times n} \\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis also leads to the expression: \\[\\begin{align*} (a^{m}b^{p})^{n} &amp; =a^{mn}b^{pn} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nBe careful as this is true for multiplication and division only , not addition or subtraction , so that \\((a+b)^{n}\\neq a^{n}+b^{n}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples of index laws\r\n\r\n \tSimplify \\(x^{5}\\times x^{6}\\).\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} x^{5}\\times x^{6} &amp; =x^{5+6}\\quad\\textrm{by the first law}\\\\ &amp; =x^{11} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(a^{5}\\div a^{3}.\\)\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} a^{5}\\div a^{3} &amp; =\\frac{a^{5}}{a^{3}}=a^{5-3}\\quad\\textrm{by the second law}\\\\ &amp; =a^{2} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\left(c^{3}\\right)^{4}\\).\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(c^{3}\\right)^{4} &amp; =c^{3\\times4}\\quad\\textrm{by the third law}\\\\ &amp; =c^{12} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\left(2x^{2}\\right)^{3}\\).\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(2x^{2}\\right)^{3} &amp; =2^{3}\\left(x^{2}\\right)^{3}\\\\ &amp; =8x^{2\\times3}\\quad\\textrm{by the third law}\\\\ &amp; =8x^{6} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nNote that terms with different bases must be considered seperately when using the index laws , such as \\((2a^{3}b^{2})^{4}=2^{4}a^{12}b^{8}\\)\r\n\r\nExercise 1 provides practice for these laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZero index\r\nSo far we have only considered expressions in which each index is a positive whole number1 Whole numbers are called integers and positive whole numbers are called the positive integers.. The index laws also apply if the index is zero, negative or a fraction (fractional indices will be dealt with in another module).\r\n\r\nConsider \\(2^{3}\\div2^{3}=\\frac{2^{3}}{2^{3}}=\\frac{2\\times2\\times2}{2\\times2\\times2}=\\frac{8}{8}=8\\div8=1\\).

For any system of equations, if the coefficient matrix is:\r\n\r\n \tSingular (that is the determinant \\(=0\\)) there will be an infinite number of solutions or no solutions.\r\n \tNon-singular (determinant \\(\\neq0\\)) there will be a unique solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInfinitely many solutions\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nConsider the system of equations \\[\\begin{align*} x+2y-z &amp; =3\\\\ x+3y &amp; =4\\\\ -x-y+2z &amp; =-2 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe augmented matrix for this system is \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 0\\\\ -1 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ 4\\\\ -2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Using elementary row operations we get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}'=R_{2}-R_{1}\\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}+R_{1} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ 1\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}-R_{2} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ 1\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] Row \\(3\\) tells us that \\(0x+0y+0z=0.\\) This is true for any value of \\(x,y\\) or \\(z.\\) So we are able to set any one of these variables to some number \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\).1 It can only be one variable as there other equations to be satisfied in \\(R_{2}\\) and \\(R_{1}.\\) For this example,2 Even though we set \\(z=t,\\) we could set either \\(x=t\\) or \\(y=t\\). We still get a solution to the system of equations but it will look different. we set \\(z=t.\\) From \\(R_{2}\\) and substituting \\(t\\) for \\(z\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} y+z &amp; =1\\\\ y+t &amp; =1\\\\ y &amp; =1-t. \\end{align*}\\] Now from \\(R_{1}\\), substituting \\(z=t,\\,y=1-t\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} x+2y-z &amp; =3\\\\ x+2\\left(1-t\\right)-t &amp; =3\\\\ x+2-2t-t &amp; =3\\\\ x &amp; =1+3t. \\end{align*}\\] So the solution is \\(x=1+3t,\\,y=1-t\\) and \\(z=t\\) where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\).3 As there are an infinite number of choices for \\(t,\\) there are an infinite number of solutions to the system of equations. \r\n\r\nIn general if the reduced augmented matrix has one or more rows of zeros, there will be an infinite number of solutions to the system of equations.4 You may recall that the determinant of a matrix with a row of zeros is zero. Hence the matrix is singular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nConsider the system of equations \\[\\begin{align*} x+2y-z &amp; =3\\\\ 2x+4y-2z &amp; =6\\\\ -5x-10y+5z &amp; =-15 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe augmented matrix for this system is \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; -2\\\\ -5 &amp; -10 &amp; 5 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ 6\\\\ -15 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Using elementary row operations we get \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}'=R_{2}-2R_{1}\\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}+5R_{1} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ 0\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] We have only one equation and three unknowns. In this case we must let two of the three variables be free. For example, we set \\(z=t\\), where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(y=s,\\) where \\(s\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) .5 It doesn\u2019t matter which two variables are selected to be a parameter \\(s\\) or \\(t.\\) We could set \\(x=s\\) and \\(y=t.\\) Substituting in row \\(1\\) gives: \\[\\begin{align*} s+2t-z &amp; =3\\\\ z &amp; =s+2t-3. \\end{align*}\\] While this looks different to the solution at left, it is still a valid solution to the set of equations.

This module shows three different ways to calculate a number to represent the spread of a set of data.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasuring spread or dispersion in data\r\nConsider the two sets of values below:\r\n\r\nSet A: \\(4,4,5,5,5,6,6\\).\r\n\r\nSet B: \\(1,3,4,5,6,7,9\\).\r\n\r\nBoth groups A and B have mean = median = \\(5\\) but the data sets are quite different.\r\n\r\nThe values in Set A are less spread out than those in Set B.\r\n\r\nRange\r\nTo compare data sets it is also useful to look at the measure of spread.\r\n\r\nThe most basic measure of spread is the range, the distance from the smallest to the largest value.\r\n\r\nSet A \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Range} &amp; =\\text{highest value$-\\text{lowest value}$ }\\\\ &amp; =6-4\\\\ &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSet B \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Range} &amp; =\\text{highest value$-\\text{lowest value}$ }\\\\ &amp; =9-1\\\\ &amp; =8. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nWe can see that Set B has greater spread than Set A. But the problem with the range is that it uses only two of the values in the data set. One of these may be an odd or unusual value called an outlier.\r\n\r\nConsider the two sets of values below:\r\n\r\nSet Y: \\(1,1,2,2,2,2,2,100\\).\r\n\r\nSet Z: \\(1,18,23,41,59,63,87,100\\).\r\n\r\nThe range for both is 99 because Set Y has one unusual value - the 100. Most of the data are ones or twos. The value of 100 is unusual and is an outlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterquartile range\r\nThe Interquartile Range (IQR) is the distance between the first quartile Q\\(_{1}\\) and the third quartile Q\\(_{3}\\).\r\n\r\nIQR = Q\\(_{3}-\\) Q\\(_{1}\\)\r\n\r\nThe first and third quartiles are values that are \\(1\/4\\) and \\(3\/4\\) of the way through the ordered data. Q\\(_{1}\\) is the median of the lower half of the data and Q\\(_{3}\\) is the median of the upper half of the data.\r\n\r\n(Note: there are other ways to find Q\\(_{1}\\) and Q\\(_{3}\\) so check with your teacher.)\r\n\r\nSet Y: \\(\\quad1\\quad\\underbrace{1\\quad\\downarrow\\quad2}_{\\text{Q$_{1}$ }}\\quad2\\quad\\mathbf{\\downarrow}\\quad2\\quad\\underbrace{\\mathbf{\\mathrm{2}\\quad\\downarrow}\\quad2}_{\\text{Q$_{3}$ }}\\quad100\\)\r\n\r\nThe arrows indicate the location of the quartiles and \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Q$_{1}$ } &amp; =\\frac{1+2}{2}\\\\ &amp; =1.5\\\\ \\text{Q$_{3}$ } &amp; =\\frac{2+2}{2}\\\\ &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the interquartile range is IQR = Q\\(_{3}-\\) Q\\(_{1}\\) = 2 \u2013 1.5 = 0.5.\r\n\r\nNow consider the other set of data:\r\n\r\nSet Z: \\(\\quad1\\quad\\underbrace{18\\quad\\downarrow\\quad23}_{\\text{Q$_{1}$ }}\\quad41\\quad\\mathbf{\\downarrow}\\quad59\\quad\\underbrace{\\mathbf{\\mathrm{63}\\quad\\downarrow}\\quad87}_{\\text{Q$_{3}$ }}\\quad100\\)\r\n\r\nWe have \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Q$_{1}$ } &amp; =\\frac{18+23}{2}\\\\ &amp; =20.5\\\\ \\text{Q$_{3}$ } &amp; =\\frac{63+87}{2}\\\\ &amp; =75. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the interquartile range is\r\n\r\nIQR = Q\\(_{3}-\\) Q\\(_{1}=75-20.5=54.5\\)\r\n\r\nSo for the data sets Y and Z the mean together with the IQR are better summaries of the data sets than the range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard deviation\r\nA measure of dispersion or spread in a data set that takes into account all of the data is the standard deviation. It gives an indication of the typical or average distance of each score from the mean for the data. The standard deviation can be calculated using the formula \\[ s=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma(x-\\overline{x})^{2}}{n-1}} \\] but it is much more convenient to use your calculator or the computer.\r\n\r\nSome statistical tests make use of the variance which is the square of the standard deviation:\r\n\r\n\\[ \\text{Variance $=$ }s^{2}=\\frac{\\Sigma(x-\\overline{x})^{2}}{n-1}. \\]\r\n\r\nSet A:\\(\\quad4\\quad4\\quad5\\quad5\\quad5\\quad6\\quad6\\)\r\n\r\n\\(\\overline{x}=5\\)\r\n\r\n\\(s=0.82\\)\r\n\r\nSet B: \\(\\quad1\\quad3\\quad4\\quad5\\quad6\\quad7\\quad9\\)\r\n\r\n\\(\\overline{x}=5\\)\r\n\r\n\\(s=2.65\\)\r\n\r\nWe can interpret the standard deviation: the scores in set A are typically \\(0.82\\) away from the mean, but the scores in set B are typically \\(2.65\\) away from the mean. Though set A and B have the same centre, those in set B are clearly more dispersed or have greater spread than set A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n1.

They give us an understanding of how buildings, structures, automobiles and materials react in real life. Moreover they are useful for data scientists.\r\nThis module does not go into each of these facets of eigenvalues and eigenvectors but describes the method for calculating them.\r\n\r\nDefinitions\r\nLet \\(A\\) be an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix. 1 The order of a matrix \\(A\\) is the number of rows in \\(A\\) times the number of columns in \\(A.\\) If \\(A\\) is a matrix with \\(5\\) rows and \\(6\\) columns, it is said to be a \\(5\\times6\\) (read as five times six) matrix, or has order \\(5\\times6\\). Eigenvector and eigenvalue problems are restricted to square matrices that is, the number of rows and columns of the matrix must be equal.\r\n\r\nLet \\(X\\) be an \\(n\\times1\\) vector. 2 Note that \\(X\\) is a column matrix (also known as a column vector).\r\n\r\nIf for some constant \\(\\lambda\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} AX &amp; =\\lambda X &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nthen \\(\\lambda\\) is called an eigenvalue of \\(A\\) and \\(X\\) is called an eigenvector of \\(A.\\) Note that \\(X\\) is a column vector of order \\(\\left(n\\times1\\right)\\). We write \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x_{n} \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Usually, if \\(A\\) is a \\(2\\times2\\) matrix, we write \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] If \\(A\\) is a \\(3\\times3\\) matrix, we write \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding eigenvalues\r\nRemember that the determinant of a matrix \\(A\\) may be written as \\(\\det A\\) or \\(\\left|A\\right|\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a square matrix \\(A\\) the eigenvalues are found by solving the equation \\[\\begin{align*} \\det\\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)=\\left|A-\\lambda I\\right| &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tEquation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) is called the CHARACTERISTIC EQUATION of the matrix \\(A.\\) So to find eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation.\r\n \tIf \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, there will be at most \\(n\\) distinct eigenvalues of \\(A\\).\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nFind the eigenvalues of the matrix \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Solution:\r\n\r\nThe \\(2\\times2\\) identity matrix, \\[\\begin{align*} I &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Hence \\[\\begin{align*} A-\\lambda I &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]-\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right] &amp; \\left(3\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\lambda &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; \\lambda \\end{array}\\right] &amp; \\left(4\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4-\\lambda &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right]. &amp; \\left(5\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Note that in practice we would not bother to include steps \\(\\left(3\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(4\\right)\\) above. We would just go directly to \\(\\left(5\\right).\\)\r\n\r\nTo find the eigenvalues we solve \\(\\det\\left[A-\\lambda I\\right]=0\\).3 This is the same as \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|A-\\lambda I\\right| &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\]  That is, \\[\\begin{align*} \\det\\left[A-\\lambda I\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\det\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4-\\lambda &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left(-4-\\lambda\\right)\\left(3-\\lambda\\right)-3\\left(-2\\right) &amp; =0\\\\ -12+4\\lambda-3\\lambda+\\lambda^{2}+6 &amp; =0\\\\ \\lambda^{2}+\\lambda-6 &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] The equation \\(\\lambda^{2}+\\lambda-6=0\\) is the characteristic equation of the matrix \\(A.\\) Factorising the characteristic equation, 4 Sometimes it is not so easy to factorise the equation. In this case you can use the quadratic formula. The solution of the quadratic \\[\\begin{align*} ax^{2}+bx+c &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] is given by \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} 0 &amp; =\\lambda^{2}-\\lambda-6\\\\ &amp; =\\left(\\lambda+3\\right)\\left(\\lambda-2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and so \\(\\lambda=-3\\) or \\(\\lambda=2\\). The two eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are \\(\\lambda_{1}=-3\\) and \\(\\lambda_{2}=2\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nFind the eigenvalues of the matrix \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Solution:\r\n\r\nWe have \\[\\begin{align*} A-\\lambda I &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2-\\lambda &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] and to find the eigenvalues we solve \\(\\det\\left[A-\\lambda I\\right]=0\\). That is \\[\\begin{align*} \\det\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2-\\lambda &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 2-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left(2-\\lambda\\right)\\left(2-\\lambda\\right) &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] So the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are \\(\\lambda_{1}=2\\) and \\(\\lambda_{2}=2\\). Note there are two eigenvalues but they have the same value. These are called repeated eigenvalues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEigenvectors\r\nTo each eigenvalue of a matrix \\(A\\) there is a corresponding eigenvector.\r\n\r\nTo find the eigenvectors we solve equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) above for each eigenvalue. It is useful to rearrange equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) as follows \\[\\begin{align*} AX &amp; =\\lambda X\\\\ AX-\\lambda X &amp; =0\\\\ \\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(6\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Note that we don\u2019t write \\(\\left(A-\\lambda\\right)X=0\\) because this makes no sense. \\(A\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix and \\(\\lambda\\) is a scalar (a number). You can\u2019t subtract a number from a matrix and so we write \\(\\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)X\\) as in equation \\(\\left(6\\right).\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo obtain eigenvectors, we solve equation \\(\\left(6\\right)\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] for each eigenvalue \\(\\lambda.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that a multiple of any eigenvector is an eigenvector. We do not consider \\(\\vec{X}=\\vec{0}\\) to be an eigenvector.\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\nFind the eigenvectors of the matrix \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nFrom example 1 above we know the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are \\(\\lambda_{1}=-3\\) and \\(\\lambda_{2}=2\\). We need to solve \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] to get the eigenvectors. Now \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(A-\\lambda I\\right)\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4-\\lambda &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; \\left(7\\right)\\\\ &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] where \\(X=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right].\\)\r\n\r\nFor \\(\\lambda_{1}=-3\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4-\\left(-3\\right) &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3-\\left(-3\\right) \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -1 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 6 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] This gives two linear equations \\[\\begin{align*} -x-2y &amp; =0\\\\ 3x+6y &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] These cannot be solved to give a unique solution as one is a multiple of another.5 Multiplying the first equation by \\(-3\\) gives the second. We have one equation and two unknowns. There will be an infinite number of solutions. Dividing the second equation by \\(3\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} x+2y &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =-2y. \\end{align*}\\] Let \\(y=t,\\;t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) then the solution is \\(x=-2t,\\,y=t\\) and the eigenvector has the form \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -2t\\\\ t \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =t\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -2\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] As \\(t\\) can be any number there are an infinite number of eigenvectors. However, the convention is that we recognise any eigenvector multiplied by a scalar is still an eigenvector and we state the eigenvector in the lowest possible terms. So, the eigenvector corresponding to \\(\\lambda_{1}=-3\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} X_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -2\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nFor \\(\\lambda_{2}=2\\), we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -4-2 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 3-2 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -6 &amp; -2\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] This gives two linear equations \\[\\begin{align*} -6x-2y &amp; =0\\\\ 3x+y &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] Again we see that the one equation is a multiple of another.6 Multiplying the first equation by \\(-3\\) gives the second. We have one equation and two unknowns. There will be an infinite number of solutions. Let \\(x=t\\) then from the second equation, \\(y=-3t\\) and the eigenvector has the form \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} t\\\\ -3t \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =t\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ -3 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] In lowest terms, the eigenvalue corresponding to \\(\\lambda_{2}=2\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} X_{2} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ -3 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSee exercise 1 for some practice examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors for \\(3\\times3\\) matrices\r\nRegardless of the size of the matrix, the method is the same. For eigenvalues we solve equation \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) and for eigenvectors we solve equation \\(\\left(6\\right).\\)\r\n\r\nExample 4\r\nFind the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\[\\begin{align*} B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Solution:\r\n\r\nFirst find the eigenvalues by solving: \\[\\begin{align*} 0 &amp; =\\det\\left[B-\\lambda I\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\det\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1-\\lambda &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0-\\lambda &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1-\\lambda \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)\\left[-\\lambda\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)-1\\left(1\\right)\\right]-1\\left[-1\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)-1\\left(-2\\right)\\right]-2\\left[1\\left(-1\\right)-\\left(-2\\right)\\left(-\\lambda\\right)\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left(1-\\lambda\\right)\\left(-\\lambda+\\lambda^{2}-1\\right)-\\left(-1+\\lambda+2\\right)-2\\left(-1-2\\lambda\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-\\lambda+\\lambda^{2}-1+\\lambda^{2}-\\lambda^{3}+\\lambda+1-\\lambda-2+2+4\\lambda\\\\ &amp; =-\\lambda^{3}+2\\lambda^{2}+3\\lambda. \\end{align*}\\] The characteristic equation is: 7 Note that the characteristic equation is a cubic, that is it is a polynomial of degree \\(3\\). If we had a \\(4\\times4\\) matrix, the characteristic equation would be a polynomial of degree \\(4\\) and so on. \\[\\begin{align*} -\\lambda^{3}+2\\lambda^{2}+3\\lambda &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] To solve this, we factorize to get: \\[\\begin{align*} -\\lambda^{3}+2\\lambda^{2}+3\\lambda &amp; =0\\\\ -\\lambda\\left(\\lambda^{2}-2\\lambda-3\\right) &amp; =0\\\\ -\\lambda\\left(\\lambda-3\\right)\\left(\\lambda+1\\right) &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the eigenvalues of \\(B\\) are: \\(\\lambda_{1}=0,\\;\\lambda_{2}=3\\) and \\(\\lambda_{3}=-1.\\) In many courses you may solve the characteristic equation using a CAS calculator. Check this with your teacher.\r\n\r\nWe now find the eigenvectors by solving equation \\(\\left(6\\right)\\) for each eigenvalue.\r\n\r\nFor \\(\\lambda_{1}=0,\\)we have 8 Note that \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(B-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0.\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1-0 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0-0 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1-0 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ x+y-2z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(8\\right)\\\\ -x+z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(9\\right)\\\\ -2x+y+z &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(10\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Solution of these equations may be done manually or, in some courses, with a CAS calculator. Check with your teacher if you are allowed to solve them with a calculator. We solve them manually below.\r\n\r\nFrom equation \\(\\left(9\\right)\\)\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} z &amp; =x. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting this in \\(\\left(8\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} x+y-2x &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =y. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the solution is \\(x=y=z=t\\) where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\). Hence the eigenvector has the form \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =t\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] So the eigenvector corresponding to \\(\\lambda_{1}=0\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} X_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nFor \\(\\lambda_{2}=3\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(B-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0.\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1-3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0-3 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1-3 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} -2 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; -3 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ -2x+y-2z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(11\\right)\\\\ -x-3y+z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(12\\right)\\\\ -2x+y-2z &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(13\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Equations \\(\\left(11\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(13\\right)\\) are identical and so we have to solve \\(\\left(11\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(12\\right).\\) Let \\(z=t\\) where \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) then \\(\\left(11\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(12\\right)\\) become \\[\\begin{align*} -2x+y &amp; =2t &amp; \\left(14\\right)\\\\ -x-3y &amp; =-t. &amp; \\left(15\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Multiplying \\(\\left(15\\right)\\) by 2 and subtracting from \\(\\left(14\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} 7y &amp; =4t\\\\ y &amp; =\\frac{4}{7}t. \\end{align*}\\] Multiplying \\(\\left(14\\right)\\) by 3 and adding to \\(\\left(15\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} -7x &amp; =5t\\\\ x &amp; =-\\frac{5}{7}t. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the eigenvector has the form \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =t\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -\\frac{5}{7}\\\\ \\frac{4}{7}\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] So the eigenvector corresponding to \\(\\lambda_{2}=3\\) is (setting \\(t=7)\\) \\[\\begin{align*} X_{2} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -5\\\\ 4\\\\ 7 \\end{array}\\right]. &amp; \\left(16\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Note that we chose \\(t=7\\) to get rid of the fraction in the eigenvector. Note also that the eigenvector \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 5\\\\ -4\\\\ -7 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] is also correct as it is just \\(\\left(16\\right)\\) multiplied by \\(-1.\\)\r\n\r\nFor \\(\\lambda_{3}=-1\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(B-\\lambda I\\right)X &amp; =0.\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1-\\left(-1\\right) &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 0-\\left(-1\\right) &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 1-\\left(-1\\right) \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; -2\\\\ -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ -2 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =0\\\\ 2x+y-2z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(17\\right)\\\\ -x+y+z &amp; =0 &amp; \\left(18\\right)\\\\ -2x+y+2z &amp; =0. &amp; \\left(19\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Adding \\(\\left(17\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(19\\right)\\) we get \\[\\begin{align*} 2y &amp; =0\\\\ y &amp; =0. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting this into \\(\\left(18\\right)\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} -x+y+z &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =z. \\end{align*}\\] Let \\(z=t,\\) \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) then the eigenvector has the form \\[\\begin{align*} X &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =t\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the eigenvector to \\(\\lambda_{3}=-1\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} X_{3} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} x\\\\ y\\\\ z \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] To summarise, the eigenvalues of \\(B\\) are \\(\\lambda_{1}=0,\\;\\lambda_{2}=3\\) and \\(\\lambda_{3}=-1.\\) The corresponding eigenvectors are \\[\\begin{align*} X_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;X_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 5\\\\ -4\\\\ -7 \\end{array}\\right]\\text{ and $X_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]$ } \\end{align*}\\] respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 5\r\nAre \\[\\begin{align*} X_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 2\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\text{ and $X_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]$ } \\end{align*}\\] eigenvectors of \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -5 &amp; 8\\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 &amp; -5 \\end{array}\\right]\\)?\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nOne way to solve this problem is to do as in Example 4 above and calculate all the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors. However, this is the long way. A shorter and better way is to use the definition of the eigenvector in equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) above.9 Recall equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} AX &amp; =\\lambda X. \\end{align*}\\] \r\n\r\nFor \\(X_{1}\\) we have from the left hand side of equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\): \\[\\begin{align*} AX_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -5 &amp; 8\\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 &amp; -5 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 2\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\times1-5\\times2+8\\times1\\\\ 1\\times1-2\\times2+1\\times1\\\\ 2\\times1-1\\times2-5\\times1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ -2\\\\ -5 \\end{array}\\right] &amp; \\left(20\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Now consider the right hand side of equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\). If \\(X_{1}\\) is an eigenvector, there exists a number \\(\\lambda\\) such that, from \\(\\left(20\\right),\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ -2\\\\ -5 \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 2\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\lambda\\\\ 2\\lambda\\\\ \\lambda \\end{array}\\right]. &amp; \\left(21\\right) \\end{align*}\\] The first two rows of \\(\\left(21\\right)\\) imply that \\(\\lambda=-1.\\) But then the third row implies that \\(-5=-1\\) which is a contradiction. We conclude that \\(X_{1}\\)is not an eigenvector of \\(A.\\)\r\n\r\nFor \\(X_{2}\\) we have from the left hand side of equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\): \\[\\begin{align*} AX_{1} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -5 &amp; 8\\\\ 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 &amp; -5 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\times\\left(-1\\right)-5\\times0+8\\times1\\\\ 1\\times\\left(-1\\right)-2\\times0+1\\times1\\\\ 2\\times\\left(-1\\right)-1\\times0-5\\times1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 7\\\\ 0\\\\ -7 \\end{array}\\right]. &amp; \\left(22\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Now consider the right hand side of equation \\(\\left(1\\right)\\). If \\(X_{2}\\) is an eigenvector, there exists a number \\(\\lambda\\) such that, from \\(\\left(22\\right),\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{c} 7\\\\ 0\\\\ -7 \\end{array}\\right] &amp; =\\lambda\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -\\lambda\\\\ 0\\\\ \\lambda \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] It is clear that \\(\\lambda=-7\\) and so \\(X_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} -1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\) is an eigenvector of the matrix \\(A\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant points to remember\r\n\r\n \tAn \\(n\\times n\\) matrix will have at most \\(n\\) distinct eigenvalues.\r\n \tAn eigenvalue may be zero.\r\n \tAn eigenvector multiplied by any number other than 0 is also an eigenvector.

In the figure below, we see an approximation to \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{1}^{6} &amp; xe^{-0.5x}dx \\end{align*}\\] using three strips. The approximated area is shown in red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this case, we see the trapezoidal rule will underestimate the first strip, is close in the second strip and will overestimate in the third strip.

The important aspect of equations \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) is that they can be re-arranged to \\(f\\left(x\\right)=0.\\) That is, the problem can be transformed to finding the root of a function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\).1 A root of a function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) is the value of \\(x\\) for which \\(f\\left(x\\right)=0.\\)\r\n\r\nCommon numerical methods for root finding are:\r\n\r\n \tNewton\u2019s method (also called the Newton-Raphson method)\r\n \tthe Bisection method.\r\n\r\nIn this module we consider Newton\u2019s method.\r\n\r\nThe Newton-Raphson method\r\nNewton\u2019s method (Newton-Raphson) can provide the value of \\(x\\) such that \\(f\\left(x\\right)=0\\).\r\n\r\nIt has the form: \\[\\begin{align*} x_{n+1} &amp; =x_{n}-\\frac{f\\left(x_{n}\\right)}{f'\\left(x_{n}\\right)} &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where \\(n\\) starts at \\(0.\\) The method is iterative, you start at \\(n=0\\) and continue by incrementing \\(n\\) by one until you achieve the desired accuracy.\r\n\r\nNote that:\r\n\r\n \t\\(x_{0}\\) is called the first estimate of the root, or the initial guess,\r\n \t\\(x_{n+1}\\) is the new estimate of the root, and \\(x_{n}\\) is the old estimate of the root,\r\n \t\\(f\\left(x_{n}\\right)\\) is the value of the function at \\(x_{n}\\) and,\r\n \t\\(f'\\left(x_{n}\\right)\\) is the value of the derivative of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) at \\(x_{n}.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nFind the solution of \\(e^{-x}=x\\) for \\(0&lt;x&lt;1\\) to three decimal places.\r\nSolution\r\nFirst define the function:2 Note that you can also use \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x-e^{-x}\\) as it is equal to zero at the same value of \\(x\\) as \\(f\\left(x\\right)=e^{-x}-x.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} f\\left(x\\right) &amp; =e^{-x}-x. \\end{align*}\\] We want to find \\(x\\) where \\(f\\left(x\\right)=0\\). To do this we need an initial guess \\(x_{0}\\) of the root. This is easily done by graphing both \\(y=x\\) and \\(y=e^{-x}.\\) The point where the graphs intersect is the point where \\(f\\left(x\\right)=0.\\) The graphs are shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA suitable value for \\(x_{0}\\) would be \\(0.5\\) and\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} f'\\left(x\\right) &amp; =-e^{-x}-1 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nUsing eqn \\(\\left(1\\right)\\), we can start the method \\[\\begin{align*} x_{1} &amp; =x_{0}-\\frac{f\\left(x_{0}\\right)}{f'\\left(x_{0}\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =0.5-\\frac{f\\left(0.5\\right)}{f'\\left(0.5\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =0.5-\\frac{e^{-0.5}-0.5}{-e^{-0.5}-1}\\\\ &amp; =0.5663\\\\ x_{2} &amp; =0.5663-\\frac{f\\left(0.5663\\right)}{f'\\left(0.5663\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =0.5663-\\frac{e^{-0.5663}-0.5663}{-e^{-0.5663}-1}\\\\ &amp; =0.5671\\\\ x_{3} &amp; =x_{2}-\\frac{f\\left(x_{2}\\right)}{f'\\left(x_{2}\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =0.5671-\\frac{e^{-0.5671}-0.5671}{-e^{-0.5671}-1}\\\\ &amp; =0.5671. \\end{align*}\\] There has been no change to the first four places so we stop and the answer is \\(x=0.567\\,.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nFind the solution of \\(-\\ln\\left(x\\right)=x^{3}\\) correct to five decimal places with an initial guess of \\(x_{0}=1.\\)\r\nSolution\r\nDefine the function \\[\\begin{align*} f\\left(x\\right) &amp; =x^{3}+\\ln\\left(x\\right) \\end{align*}\\] then \\[\\begin{align*} f'\\left(x\\right) &amp; =3x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x}. \\end{align*}\\] In this case we have a value for \\(x_{0}\\) so there is no need to graph the functions. But we do it anyway.3 It is a good idea to graph the functions because it allows us to get an idea of the answer. If Newton\u2019s method gives a result that is different to what we see in the graph, we have to consider that a mistake has been made or Newton\u2019s method has found another root that we did not see on our graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the graph we see the answer should be about \\(0.7\\).\r\n\r\nUsing Newton\u2019s method: \\[\\begin{align*} x_{1} &amp; =x_{0}-\\frac{f\\left(x_{0}\\right)}{f'\\left(x_{0}\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =1-\\frac{1^{3}+\\ln\\left(1\\right)}{3\\cdot1^{2}+\\left(\\frac{1}{1}\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =1-\\frac{1+0}{3+1}\\\\ &amp; =0.75\\\\ x_{2} &amp; =0.75-\\frac{\\left(0.75\\right)^{3}+\\ln\\left(0.75\\right)}{3\\cdot\\left(0.75\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{1}{0.75}\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =0.7055775\\\\ x_{3} &amp; =0.7055775-\\frac{\\left(0.7055775\\right)^{3}+\\ln\\left(0.7055775\\right)}{3\\cdot\\left(0.7055775\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{1}{0.7055775}\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =0.7047098\\\\ x_{4} &amp; =0.7047098-\\frac{\\left(0.7047098\\right)^{3}+\\ln\\left(0.7047098\\right)}{3\\cdot\\left(0.7047098\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{1}{0.7047098}\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =0.7047095. \\end{align*}\\] As we have no change in the first five places after the decimal point we stop and take the answer as \\(x=0.70471\\,.\\) Note that we round up the fifth digit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConvergence of the Newton-Raphson method\r\nConvergence indicates how quickly you will get an acceptable value of \\(f\\left(x\\right)=0\\). Slow convergence implies many iterations, while fast convergence means few iterations.\r\n\r\nConvergence of the method depends on the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) and the initial guess. If the initial guess is in an area where the gradient of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) is nearly zero, convergence can be slow.\r\n\r\nConsider the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{4}-1.\\) It is graphed below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously the solutions of \\(f\\left(x\\right)=0\\) are \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=1\\). These can be obtained by basic algebra and there is no need to use Newton\u2019s method. However we will use this function to see what happens with different guesses for \\(x_{0}\\). We assume an accuracy to two decimal places and a calculation tolerance of \\(0.0000001\\).\r\n\r\nLet \\(x_{0}=0.1\\). In this region the gradient of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) is close to zero. Newton\u2019s method takes 25 iterations to get the result \\(x=1.00.\\)\r\n\r\nLet \\(x_{0}=0.25\\) then it takes 15 iterations to get the result \\(x=1.00.\\)\r\n\r\nLet \\(x_{0}=0.5\\) then it takes 9 iterations to get the result \\(x=1.00.\\)\r\n\r\nLet \\(x_{0}=0.75\\) then it takes 6 iterations to get the result \\(x=1.00.\\)\r\n\r\nSo we see the number of iterations decrease (higher convergence) when the gradient of \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConvergence to another root\r\nIf the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\) has several roots, Newton\u2019s method may converge to any of these. For example the function \\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{3}+2x^{2}-5x-6\\) has three roots at \\(x=-3,-1\\) and \\(2\\) as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we set \\(x_{0}=-2\\) we, perhaps, would think the method should find the root \\(x=-3\\text{ or $-1$ }.\\) But Newton\u2019s method finds the root at \\(x=2.\\) This is why it is important to graph the function if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page, NM1 Newton\u2019s method (PDF 727KB)\r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"You are used to solving equations using basic algebraic operations and perhaps the quadratic formula.

Simpson\u2019s rule is a numerical method that calculates a numerical value for a definite integral.\r\nYou will have evaluated definite integrals such as \\[\\begin{align*} \\int_{1}^{3} &amp; \\left(x^{2}\\right)dx \\end{align*}\\] before.

Examples of physical properties include:\r\n\r\n \tShape \u2013 the external form of a substance\r\n \tColour \u2013 the appearance of a substance (its hue, saturation and lightness) due to the reflection of light\r\n \tOdour \u2013 the smell or scent of a substance\r\n \tHardness \u2013 the ability of a substance to resist being scratched\r\n \tMelting point \u2013 the temperature at which the substance changes from a solid to a liquid\r\n \tBoiling point \u2013 the temperature at which the substance changes from a liquid to a gas or vapour\r\n \tPhysical state \u2013 whether the substance is a liquid, solid or gas.\r\n\r\n\r\nChemical properties\r\nIf the property can only be observed or measured by altering the chemical identity of the substance, it is a chemical property. Examples of chemical properties include:\r\n\r\n \tFlammability \u2013 the ability of a substance to ignite or burn\r\n \tCorrosiveness \u2013 the ability of a substance to rust after exposure to moist air for prolonged periods of time\r\n \tAcidity \u2013 the ability of a substance to donate hydrogen ions and decrease the pH of a solution\r\n \tReactivity \u2013 the ability of a substance to undergo a chemical reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nClassification of matter\r\nMatter can be classified in many ways.

This is the atomic model, which describes the structure of atoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProtons, neutrons and electrons are subatomic particles. Subatomic particles present in the nucleus are known as nucleons (e.g.\u00a0protons and neutrons). Properties of the subatomic particles are given in the table. You can see that protons and neutrons are almost identical in mass, whereas electrons are much smaller.

To calculate the atomic mass, the relative percentage abundance and atomic mass of each isotope is considered.

For example, let \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right],\\,B=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]\\;\\textrm{and $C=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3\\\\ 4 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]$ }. \\end{align*}\\] Then \\(A-B\\) makes sense because they are both \\(\\left(2\\times3\\right)\\) and we have \\[\\begin{align*} A-B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3-1 &amp; 2-0 &amp; -1-2\\\\ 1-3 &amp; 5-1 &amp; -4-(-2) \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 2 &amp; -3\\\\ -2 &amp; 4 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nHowever \\(A-C\\) is not defined as \\(A\\) is \\(\\left(2\\times3\\right)\\) and \\(C\\) is \\(\\left(2\\times2\\right)\\). You cannot subtract matrices that have different shape. As another example consider \\(B-A\\) we have \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} B-A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1-3 &amp; 0-2 &amp; 2-(-1)\\\\ 3-1 &amp; 1-5 &amp; -2-(-4) \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} -2 &amp; -2 &amp; 3\\\\ 2 &amp; -4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{alignat*}\\] Note that \\(A-B\\neq B-A\\). The order in which matrices are subtracted is important just as it is when subtracting real numbers. In fact, \\(B-A=-\\left(A-B\\right)\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScalar multiplication\r\nMatrices may be multiplied by a number. To do this each element in the matrix is multiplied by the number.\r\n\r\nFor example, let \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 5 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\textrm{ and $B=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3\\\\ 0 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]$ } \\end{align*}\\] then \\[\\begin{align*} 5A &amp; =5\\times\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 5 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5\\times1 &amp; 5\\times2\\\\ 5\\times5 &amp; 5\\times4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5 &amp; 10\\\\ 25 &amp; 20 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nAnother example is \\[\\begin{align*} -2A &amp; =-2\\times\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 5 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -2\\times1 &amp; -2\\times2\\\\ -2\\times5 &amp; -2\\times4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -2 &amp; -4\\\\ -10 &amp; -8 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nYou can also use scalar multiplication with addition or subtraction. For example: \\[\\begin{align*} 5A-2B &amp; =5\\times\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 5 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]-2\\times\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3\\\\ 0 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5\\times1 &amp; 5\\times2\\\\ 5\\times5 &amp; 5\\times4 \\end{array}\\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2\\times2 &amp; 2\\times\\left(-3\\right)\\\\ 2\\times0 &amp; 2\\times\\left(-1\\right) \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5 &amp; 10\\\\ 25 &amp; 20 \\end{array}\\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 4 &amp; -6\\\\ 0 &amp; -2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5-4 &amp; 10-\\left(-6\\right)\\\\ 25-0 &amp; 20-\\left(-2\\right) \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 16\\\\ 25 &amp; 22 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n \tGiven \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 2\\\\ 3 \\end{array}\\right],\\;B=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 4 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right],\\;C=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 5 &amp; 3\\\\ -1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right],\\;D=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 3\\end{array}\\right],\\;E=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} -1 &amp; 0\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right], \\end{align*}\\] find if possible: \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{lllll} a)\\,A+B &amp; b)\\,B-C &amp; c)\\,A-D &amp; d)\\,B+E &amp; e)\\,E-D.\\end{array} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tGiven \\[\\begin{align*} A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right],\\;B=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 4\\\\ -1\\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right],\\;C=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\\\ 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;D=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 0\\\\ -1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;E=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 3\\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right], \\end{align*}\\] find if possible: \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{lllll} a)\\,2A+B &amp; b)\\,4D-B &amp; c)\\,3C-A &amp; d)\\,B+2D+E &amp; e)\\,3C-A+2E\\end{array}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page, M2 Addition and subtraction of matrices (PDF 110KB)\r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"There are rules for adding and subtracting matrices and these are reviewed in this module.

Matrices may also be multiplied, however the requirements for multiplication are very different to that for addition\/subtraction.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatrix shape or order of a matrix\r\nThe shape of a matrix is the number of rows and columns. When describing a matrix you give the number of rows by the number of columns. This is sometimes called the order of the matrix. For example, the matrix \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 0\\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] is a said to be a one by four matrix as it has \\(1\\) row and \\(4\\) columns. We could also say the order of \\(A\\) is \\(1\\times4\\). The matrix \\[\\begin{align*} B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 5\\\\ 2 &amp; 6\\\\ 4 &amp; 7\\\\ 5 &amp; 89 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] is a \\(5\\times2\\) matrix because it has \\(5\\) rows and \\(2\\) columns. It has order \\(5\\times2\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConditions for matrix multiplication\r\nTwo matrices can be multiplied if the number of columns of the first matrix is the same as the number of rows of the second matrix. The result of the multiplication is another matrix with the same number of rows as the first matrix and the same number of columns as the second matrix. If this is not the case, the multiplication is undefined.\r\n\r\nSymbolically let \\(A\\) be an \\(m\\times p\\) matrix and let \\(B\\) be an \\(q\\times n\\) matrix. Then the product \\(A\\times B=AB\\) will be an \\(m\\times n\\) matrix provided that \\(p=q\\). If \\(p\\neq q\\) the matrix multiplication is not defined. For example, a \\(2\\times3\\) matrix cannot be multiplied by a \\(1\\times4\\) matrix because \\(3\\neq1\\) whereas it is possible to multiply a \\(2\\times3\\) matrix by a \\(3\\times2\\) and the result will be a \\(2\\times2\\) matrix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatrix multiplication\r\nLet \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right], &amp; B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] we want to find, if it exists, the product \\(AB\\). First note that we are multiplying a \\(2\\times3\\) matrix by a \\(3\\times2\\) and so matrix multiplication is possible and the result will be a \\(2\\times2\\) matrix. You should always check that the multiplication is possible.\r\n\r\nNow the multiplication procedure is a bit strange at first. The first element of row \\(1\\) of the resulting matrix \\(AB\\) is found by multiplying each element of the first row of \\(A\\) by the corresponding element in the first column of \\(B\\) and then adding products as shown below: \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2\\times1+4\\times3+5\\times4 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;1\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2+12+20 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;1\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;1\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] The 2nd element of row \\(1\\) is found by multiplying each element of the first row of \\(A\\) by the corresponding element in the second column of \\(B\\) and then adding products as shown below: \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 2\\times6+4\\times1+5\\times2\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 12+4+10\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 1st\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] The 1st element of row \\(2\\) is found by multiplying each element of the second row of \\(A\\) by the corresponding element in the first column of \\(B\\) and then adding products as shown below: \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 7\\times1+8\\times3+9\\times4 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 7+24+36 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 67 &amp; 2nd\\;element\\;of\\;row\\;2 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] Finally the the 2nd element of row \\(2\\) is found by multiplying each element of the second row of \\(A\\) by the corresponding element in the second column of \\(B\\) and then adding products as shown below: \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5\\\\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 6\\\\ 3 &amp; 1\\\\ 4 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 67 &amp; 7\\times6+8\\times1+9\\times2 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 7+24+36 &amp; 42+8+18 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 34 &amp; 26\\\\ 67 &amp; 68 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nLet \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right], &amp; B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] Find a) \\(AB\\;\\) b) \\(BA\\;\\) c) \\(AA\\;\\) d) \\(BB\\) if they exist.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\n \tSince \\(A\\) is \\(2\\times2\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(2\\times3\\), the number of columns in \\(A\\) is equal to the number of rows in \\(B\\) and so \\(AB\\) exists and will be a \\(2\\times3\\) matrix. We have: \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2\\times2+1\\times0 &amp; 2\\times1+1\\times2 &amp; 2\\times0+1\\times1\\\\ 3\\times2+0\\times0 &amp; 3\\times1+0\\times2 &amp; 3\\times0+0\\times1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 4 &amp; 4 &amp; 1\\\\ 6 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tThe number of columns of \\(B\\) is \\(3\\) and the number of rows of \\(A\\) is \\(2\\). Since they are unequal, \\(BA\\) is not defined and \\(BA\\) does not exist.\r\n \tSince \\(A\\) has the same number of rows and columns1 \\(A\\) is called a square matrix.  and so \\(AA\\) exists.2 We sometimes write \\(AA=A^{2.}.\\) We have: \\[\\begin{align*} AA &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2\\times2+1\\times3 &amp; 2\\times1+1\\times0\\\\ 3\\times2+0\\times3 &amp; 3\\times1+0\\times0 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 7 &amp; 2\\\\ 6 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tThe number of columns and rows in \\(B\\) are unequal and so \\(BB\\) does not exist.3 Only square matrices can be squared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\nLet \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right], &amp; B &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] find if they exist, a) \\(AB\\) and b) \\(BA\\).\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\n \tSince the number of columns and rows is the same for matrices \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), both \\(BC\\) and \\(CB\\) exist and will be \\(2\\times2\\) matrices. We have \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2\\times1+\\left(-1\\right)\\times2 &amp; 2\\times0+\\left(-1\\right)\\times\\left(-1\\right)\\\\ 1\\times1+3\\times2 &amp; 1\\times0+3\\times\\left(-1\\right) \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; 1\\\\ 7 &amp; -3 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} BA &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1\\times2+0\\times1 &amp; 1\\times\\left(-1\\right)+0\\times3\\\\ 2\\times2+\\left(-1\\right)\\times1 &amp; 2\\times\\left(-1\\right)+\\left(-1\\right)\\times3 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1\\\\ 3 &amp; -5 \\end{array}\\right] \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nFrom this example we can see that, in general, \\(AB\\neq BA\\). We say that matrix multiplication is not commutative and the order of multiplication matters. There is an exception to this as explained in the next section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplication by the unit matrix\r\nA square matrix with ones along its leading diagonal and zeros elsewhere is called a unit matrix (also called an identity matrix). The order of the unit matrix is sometimes noted with a subscript. For example,\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} I_{1}=\\left[1\\right],\\;I_{2} &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;I_{3}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;I_{4}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right],\\;I_{n}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0\\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe unit matrix acts like the number one in the real number system. When matrix multiplication is defined, multiplication by the unit matrix leaves the original matrix unchanged.\r\n\r\nMultiplying a square \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) by the unit matrix \\(I_{n}\\) shows that the order of multiplication does not matter.4 This is only true for square matrices That is \\[\\begin{align*} AI_{n} &amp; =I_{n}A. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nFor example, let \\(A=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\). Since \\(A\\) has two columns we need the unit matrix to have two rows and two columns. That is \\(I=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\). Then \\[\\begin{align*} AI &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1\\times1+2\\times0 &amp; 1\\times0+2\\times1\\\\ 3\\times1+3\\times0 &amp; 3\\times0+4\\times1 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =A \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} IA &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1\\times1+0\\times3 &amp; 1\\times2+0\\times4\\\\ 0\\times1+1\\times3 &amp; 0\\times2+1\\times4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array}\\right]\\\\ &amp; =A. \\end{align*}\\] So, in this case, \\(AI=IA=A\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nLet \\[\\begin{align*} A &amp; =\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 4 &amp; -1\\\\ 1 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right],\\;B=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 3\\\\ -2 &amp; -4\\\\ 2 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right],\\;C=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 3 &amp; 1 &amp; -5\\\\ 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 4\\\\ 1 &amp; 6 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\right],\\;D=\\left[\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ 2\\\\ -2 \\end{array}\\right],\\;E=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} -3 &amp; 2 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 5 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Find (if they exist)\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lllllllcc} a)\\,BA &amp; b)\\,DB &amp; c)\\,CD &amp; d)\\,AA=A^{2} &amp; e)\\,BB=B^{2} &amp; f)\\,AD &amp; g)\\,BE &amp; h)\\,EA &amp; i)\\,CB\\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page, M3 Matrix multiplication (PDF 128KB)\r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"Matrices may be added and subtracted if they have the same shape; that is, the number of rows and columns is the same.

In example 2 we did that by interchanging rows. In this case, that won\u2019t work. However row \\(1\\) can be divided by \\(2\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} R_{1}'=R_{1}\/2\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ -2\\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Now we proceed in the usual way. In this example we do not put in all the comments. \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}'=R_{2}-3R_{1}\\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; -2\\\\ 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 3 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ 7\\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}-2R_{1} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; -2\\\\ 0 &amp; 8 &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ 7\\\\ 8 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=7R_{3}-8R_{2} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; -2\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 23 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} -3\\\\ 7\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nFrom \\(R_{3}\\)we have \\(23z=0\\) and so \\(z=0.\\) Substituting this into \\(R_{2}\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} 7y-2z &amp; =7\\\\ 7y-2\\left(0\\right) &amp; =7\\\\ 7y &amp; =7\\\\ y &amp; =1. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting \\(z=0,\\,y=1\\) into \\(R_{1}\\) we get \\[\\begin{align*} x-y+z &amp; =-3\\\\ x-1+0 &amp; =-3\\\\ x &amp; =-2. \\end{align*}\\] The solution is \\(x=-2,\\,y=1,\\,z=0\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInfinite number of solutions\r\nIn all the examples above we had a unique solution. That is, \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z\\) were associated with a single number. It is possible that a set of simultaneous equations has an infinite number of solutions. Imagine after using row operations you get an augmented matrix like \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} a &amp; b &amp; c\\\\ 0 &amp; e &amp; f\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} d\\\\ g\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] In this case \\(R_{3}\\) tells us nothing. We basically have \\(2\\) equations and \\(3\\) unknowns. In this case we will have an infinite number of solutions and the variables \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\) will be in terms of some parameter. The following example illustrates this case.\r\n\r\nExample 4\r\nSolve the following set of equations: \\[\\begin{align*} x+y+z &amp; =3\\\\ 2x-y+z &amp; =5\\\\ 3x+2z &amp; =8. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nSolution: The augmented matrix is \\[\\begin{align*} \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 2 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ 5\\\\ 8 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] Performing row operations we get \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ R_{2}'=R_{2}-2R_{1}\\\\ \\\\ \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -1\\\\ 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ -1\\\\ 8 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}-3R_{1} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -1 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ -1\\\\ -1 \\end{array}\\right.\\right] \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\begin{array}{c} \\\\ \\\\ R_{3}'=R_{3}-R_{2} \\end{array}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\\\ 0 &amp; -3 &amp; -1\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c} 3\\\\ -1\\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right.\\right]. \\end{align*}\\] We can go no further with elementary row operations and so start back substitution. Row \\(3\\) tells us nothing. From row \\(2\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} -3y-z &amp; =-1\\\\ 3y+z &amp; =1. \\end{align*}\\] This is an equation with two unknowns. In this case we let one of the variables, either \\(y\\) or \\(z\\) be free. That is we let \\(y\\) or \\(z\\) be equal to some parameter \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\). It doesn\u2019t matter which variable you choose to be free, though the answer will look different. We will set \\(z=t\\) then we have \\[\\begin{align*} 3y+z &amp; =1\\\\ 3y+t &amp; =1\\\\ 3y &amp; =1-t\\\\ y &amp; =\\frac{1-t}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] From row \\(1\\) and substituting \\(z=t\\) and \\(y=\\left(1-t\\right)\/3\\) we have \\[\\begin{align*} x+y+z &amp; =3\\\\ x+\\frac{1-t}{3}+t &amp; =3\\\\ 3x+1-t+3t &amp; =9\\\\ 3x &amp; =8-2t\\\\ x &amp; =\\frac{8-2t}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] So the solution here is \\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =\\frac{8-2t}{3},y=\\frac{1-t}{3},z=t,\\;t\\in\\mathbb{R}. \\end{align*}\\] This gives us an infinite number of solutions because \\(t\\) can be any real number. To check the solution you can pick any value of \\(t,\\)determine \\(x,y\\) and \\(z\\) and substitute in the original equations. For example let \\(t=0\\).3 Here we took \\(t=0\\) because it is easy to get the corresponding \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z\\) values. But you can pick any value of \\(t\\). Once you choose \\(t\\), there will be a corresponding value of \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z.\\) These \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z\\) values will satisfy the original equations. Note that picking a value of \\(t\\) and checking if the corresponding \\(x,\\,y\\) and \\(z\\) values will the original equation is not a proof that your solution is correct. A real proof would have to consider all values of \\(t.\\) However it is a useful check. Then\\[\\begin{align*} x &amp; =\\frac{8}{3},y=\\frac{1}{3},z=0. \\end{align*}\\] Substituting in equation 1 gives \\[\\begin{align*} LHS &amp; =x+y+z\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{8}{3}+\\frac{1}{3}+0\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{9}{3}\\\\ &amp; =3\\\\ &amp; =RHS. \\end{align*}\\] You can substitute into the second and third equation to check this solution is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nFind the solutions to the following systems of equations:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{llcll} 1. &amp; x-y-2z=-6 &amp; \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad &amp; 2. &amp; 2x+y+2z=4\\\\ &amp; 2x-3y+3z=1 &amp; &amp; &amp; 2x+4y-2z=6\\\\ &amp; 3x-y+4z=4 &amp; &amp; &amp; -y+3z=1 \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lllccll} 3. &amp; x_{1}-x_{2}-2x_{3}=1 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\quad &amp; 4. &amp; x-2y+z-w=0\\\\ &amp; -3x_{1}+2x_{2}+4x_{3}=-3 &amp; \\quad &amp; \\quad &amp; &amp; &amp; 2x+4y-3z=0\\\\ &amp; 2x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}=1 &amp; \\quad &amp; \\quad &amp; &amp; &amp; 3x+2y+2z-w=0 \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page, M6 Systems of equations (PDF 181KB)\r\n\r\nImages on this page by RMIT, licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.","excerpt":"Matrices can be used to solve systems of equations by using elementary row operations and the augmented matrix.

Force equals mass times acceleration. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\r\nDo you need to learn about Newton's first three laws? This page will help your understanding of these laws and explain applications for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Newton\u2019s first 3 laws?\r\n\r\n \tAn object in motion tends to stay in motion and an object at rest tends to stay at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.\r\n \tForce \\(\\left(F\\right)\\) equals mass \\(\\left(m\\right)\\) times acceleration \\(\\left(a\\right)\\). That is \\(F=ma\\).\r\n \tFor every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNet (sum of the forces or resultant) force is represented by \\(\\Sigma F\\)\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\sum F\\)= (sum of the forces) = \\(150-100=50\\) Newton to the Right \\(\\therefore\\) unbalanced force so accelerating to the right\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\sum F\\)= (sum of the forces) = \\(150-100=50\\) Newton to the Left \\(\\therefore\\) unbalanced force so accelerating to the left\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(\\sum F\\)= (sum of the forces) = \\(150-150=0\\) Newton \\(\\therefore\\) balanced force so is stationary or moving at a constant speed\r\n\r\nNo acceleration but could be at rest or moving at constant velocity (remember F=ma so no acceleration but it could be moving)\r\nNote : Force is a vector quantity, so direction must be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNewton's 1st law of motion\r\nEvery object continues to be at rest, or continues with constant velocity, unless it experiences an unbalanced force.\r\n\r\nSeatbelts are fitted in cars to take into account Newton's 1st Law of Motion. If, for instance, you had to brake suddenly and you were not wearing your seatbelt, then by Newton's 1st Law, you would continue to travel at a uniform speed \u2013 the speed of the car just before braking \u2013 until you made contact with the windscreen. That is, the sum of the forces acting on you was zero at the instant you braked even though the car was being acted upon by a braking force. The windscreen would then exert a force on you as you hit it. As it did to the author of this worksheet when he was 13 years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNewton's 2nd law of motion\r\nThis law relates to the (sum of \\(\\Sigma\\) ) the (forces F) written as \\(\\Sigma F\\) s acting on an object and the acceleration produced as a consequence of this resultant force. It is given by:\r\nSum of the Forces = \\(\\Sigma F=ma\\)\r\nwhere \\(\\Sigma F\\) is the sum of the forces (in Newtons), \u2018m\u2019 is the mass of the object (in\\(kg\\)), and \u2018a\u2019 is the acceleration (in \\(ms^{-2}\\)). Note: \\(\\Sigma F\\) must have the same direction as acceleration as force is also a vector.\r\n\r\nWhen doing Newton's 2nd law problems, draw all forces acting on the object in question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\nA toy car of mass \\(2kg\\) has a driving force \\(F_{D}\\) of \\(20N\\). The frictional force \\(F_{F}\\) acting on the car is \\(10Newton\\). Find the cars acceleration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nThe net force acting on the car is the driving force minus the frictional force: \\[\\begin{align*} \\Sigma F &amp; =F_{D}-F_{F}\\\\ &amp; =20-10\\\\ &amp; =10N. \\end{align*}\\] Using Newton\u2019s 2nd law1 The second law is: \\(\\Sigma F=ma\\). we get \\[\\begin{align*} ma &amp; =10\\\\ 2a &amp; =10\\\\ a &amp; =5ms^{-2}. \\end{align*}\\] The magnitude of the car\u2019s acceleration is \\(5ms^{-2}\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNewton\u2019s 3rd law of motion\r\nWhen two objects interact, the forces they exert on each other are equal in size, but opposite in direction. These pairs of forces are called action-reaction forces.\r\n\r\nYou need to appreciate that each force in the action-reaction pair acts on different objects. This is different to Newton's 2nd law where you analyze forces that are acting on the same object. Note that each force is equal in size but opposite in direction to its paired force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNormal force \\(F_{N}\\)\r\nA normal force acts at right angles to the surface with which it is in contact. For instance, if you are currently sitting on a chair reading this handout, then the chair is in contact with the floor and so there is a contact force of the chair acting on the floor given by \\(F_{CF}\\). By Newton's 3rd law the floor will exert an equal but opposite force on the chair of \\(F_{FC}\\). \\(F_{FC}\\) is also called the normal force \\(F_{N}\\). If this is not the case then you will either fall through the floor or fly up into the sky. See diagram below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\(F_{FC}=\\) \\(-\\) \\(F_{CF}\\) where the negative sign indicates that these forces are acting in opposite directions. Recall your notes on vectors. The magnitude of the forces are equal but the direction is opposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApplications of Newton's laws\r\nA starting point when analyzing Newton's 2nd law problems is to draw all forces acting on the object in question.\r\n\r\nObjects in lifts\r\n\r\n\r\n \tIf accelerating down (as shown): \\[\\begin{align*} \\Sigma F &amp; =ma\\\\ mg-F &amp; =ma \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nAccelerating down then gravity is winning or larger. Accelerating up then Normal force is winning or larger. Acceleration has magnitude and is directional , it is a vector. where \\(g\\) is the acceleration of gravity (see diagram)\r\n\r\n \tIf accelerating up: \\[\\begin{align*} \\Sigma F &amp; =ma\\\\ F_{N}-mg &amp; =ma \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tIf not accelerating at all:2 It is stationary or moving at a constant velocity. \\[\\begin{align*} \\Sigma F &amp; =0\\\\ F_{N}-mg &amp; =0\\\\ F_{N} &amp; =mg \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjects bouncing\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the bounce (the instant the ball is in contact with the surface):\r\n\r\n \t\\(F_{N}\\) &gt; mg, because a &gt; 0 and is upwards. Therefore there is a resultant force acting which is upwards (as the ball will now head up).\r\n \t\\(F_{N}\\) can often be much larger than mg (for the ball to bounce).\r\n \tAt the instant the object is stationary\r\n\r\n(just before it changes direction and heads up)\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\Sigma F &amp; =0\\\\ F_{N}-mg &amp; =0\\\\ F_{N} &amp; =mg \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObject being pulled along a surface\r\n\\(T\\) = tension in rope , \\(a\\) = acceleration of object , \\(m\\) = mass of object, \\(F_{N}\\) is the normal force of the table pushing on the block, \\(mg\\) is the force of the block pushing on the table. Remember that \\(g\\) is acceleration of gravity, \\(F_{f}\\) is the force of friction the table exerts on the object\r\n\r\nHorizontally: \\(\\Sigma F\\)= \\(T\\) \\(=\\) \\(ma\\)\r\n\r\nVertically: \\(\\Sigma F=F_{N}-mg=0\\)\r\n\r\nTherefore \\(F_{N}=\\) \\(mg\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nHorizontally: \\(\\sum F\\)= T - \\(F_{f}\\)=\\(ma\\)\r\n\r\nVertically: \\(\\sum F=F_{N}-mg=0\\)\r\n\r\nTherefore \\(F_{N}=\\) \\(mg\\)\r\n\r\n\r\nExample\r\nA car of mass 800kg accelerates from rest to \\(20\\) \\(ms^{-1}\\) in \\(\\text{$8.0\\sec$ }\\). The resistance forces acting on the car total \\(1000N\\).\r\n\r\nFind (a) the acceleration of the car, and (b) the driving force of the car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tAcceleration is given by the change in velocity divided by the time taken, or\r\n\r\nremember \u201cfrom rest\u201d means \\(u=0\\), final velocity is \\(v=20\\) and time \\(t=8\\)\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} a &amp; =\\frac{v-u}{t}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{20-0}{8}\\\\ &amp; =2.5ms^{-2} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n \tNet Force \\(\\Sigma F=F_{D}-F_{F}=ma\\)\r\n\r\nTherefore \\[\\begin{align*} F_{D}-F_{F} &amp; =m\\times a\\\\ F_{D}-1000 &amp; =800\\times2.5\\\\ F_{D} &amp; =800\\times2.5+1000\\\\ F_{D} &amp; =2000+1000\\\\ F_{D} &amp; =3000N \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe driving force of the car is therefore \\(3000\\) Newton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise\r\n\r\n \tWhat resultant force is needed to give a mass of 6.4 kg an acceleration of\\(2.4\\) \\(ms^{-2}\\) West?\r\n \tIf a resultant force of \\(48\\) Newton produces an acceleration of \\(1.2\\) \\(ms^{-2}\\) on an object, what is the mass of the object?\r\n \tA resultant force of \\(5.0\\) Newton acts on an object and causes it to reach a velocity of \\(4.0\\) \\(ms^{-1}\\) in \\(2.5\\sec\\).

Be careful with negative and positive signs!\r\n \tIf, for instance, the two cars collide and stay together after the collision, then the momentum of the two cars before the collision is equal to the momentum of the lockedtogether cars after the collision.\r\n \tMathematically, problems on collisions or explosions are similar, except that for an explosion, the momentum of the system before the blast is often zero.\r\n \tIn closed systems no external forces act. For example, a spacecraft colliding in deep space experiences no external force because there is no gravitational field. Systems close to the Earths surface are systems that are not closed because the external force acting is the Earths gravitational force. To make them closed one has to include the Earth as part of the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMomentum transfer involving the Earth\r\nThe following two situations describe how momentum is transferred to the Earth.\r\n\r\n \tA ball is thrown up: it rises against gravity and then slows down and stops, losing momentum due to the earth. The ball starts to fall under the influence of gravity, speeding up thereby giving the earth an equal and opposite momentum change. The falling ball hits the ground. The momentum is not lost. It is transferred to the earth.\r\n \tA bicycle on the flat is slowed down due to friction.

Describing these motions require some technical terms such as displacement, distance, velocity, speed and acceleration. The terms and their relationships to one another are described in this module.\r\n\r\n\r\nScalar and vector quantities\r\nQuantities that have only a magnitude and no specified direction are called scalar quantities. Examples are time, speed and distance. Quantities that have both magnitude and direction are called vector quantities. Examples are displacement, velocity and acceleration. We discuss these below.\r\n\r\nDisplacement \\(\\left(x\\right)\\)\r\nWhen an object is moved from one point to another it is said to be displaced. If we move to Dandenong we can say we have been displaced \\(32\\,km\\) from Melbourne, but to define our position, we need to specify a direction and say we are \\(32\\,km\\) South East of Melbourne. That is we give a magnitude (\\(32\\,km\\)) and a direction (South East). Consequently displacement is a vector quantity.\r\n\r\nNote that displacement is often referred to as position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDistance \\(\\left(d\\right)\\)\r\nDistance is the magnitude (size) of the displacement, but has no direction so it is a scalar quantity. For example you can say my distance is \\(60\\,km\\) away, but your displacement is \\(60\\,km\\) in a direction - such as \\(60\\,km\\) West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVelocity \\(\\left(v\\right)\\)\r\nVelocity \\(v\\) is the rate of change of displacement \\(x\\). That is, for an object moving at constant velocity, \\[\\begin{align*} v &amp; =\\frac{x}{t} \\end{align*}\\] where \\(t\\) is the time taken. Since displacement is a vector quantity, so is velocity. The units of velocity depend on the units of displacement and time. If displacement is in metres \\(\\left(m\\right)\\) and time is in seconds \\(\\left(s\\right)\\) the unit of velocity is metres per second and is written as \\(m\/s\\) or \\(ms^{-1}.\\) 1 Note that \\(m\/s\\) is metres divided by seconds. The notation \\(ms^{-1}\\) uses indicial notation. Here \\(s^{-1}=1\/s\\) and so \\[\\begin{align*} ms^{-1} &amp; =m\\times s^{-1}\\\\ &amp; =m\\times\\frac{1}{s}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{m}{s}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeed\r\nThe speed of an object is the magnitude (size) of it\u2019s velocity.

That is \\[\\begin{align*} a &amp; =\\frac{v}{t}. \\end{align*}\\] If \\(v\\) is in metres per second, the unit of acceleration is metres per second per second2 The notation \\(ms^{-2}\\) uses indicial notation. Here \\(s^{-2}=1\/s^{2}\\) and so \\[\\begin{align*} ms^{-2} &amp; =m\\times s^{-2}\\\\ &amp; =m\\times\\frac{1}{s^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{m}{s^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =m\/s^{2}. \\end{align*}\\] and is written as \\(m\/s^{2}\\) or \\(ms^{-2}.\\) Since velocity is a vector quantity, so too is acceleration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDistance vs time graphs\r\nLet\u2019s suppose a person, starting from rest, runs a distance \\(\\left(d\\right)\\) of \\(12\\,m\\) in a time \\(\\left(t\\right)\\) of \\(2\\,s.\\) We could graph this as:3 Here we are assuming that the speed is constant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the gradient of a distance (a scalar quantity) versus time graph gives the speed (also a scalar quantity). In this case, the speed is given by \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{speed} &amp; =\\frac{d}{t}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{12}{2}\\\\ &amp; =6\\,m\/s. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisplacement vs time graphs\r\nConsider the graph below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that this is displacement (a vector quantity) versus time. Whereas the gradient of the distance versus time graph gave speed, the gradient of the displacement (a vector) versus time graph gives velocity (a vector).\r\n\r\nLooking at the graph, from A to B the object is moving at a constant velocity (because the graph is a straight line). Its velocity \\(v\\) is the gradient of the line from A to B. That is \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{$v$ } &amp; =\\frac{displacement\\;at\\;\\text{B$-displacement\\;at\\;A$ }}{time\\;at\\;\\text{B$-time\\;at\\;\\text{A}$ }}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{8-0}{2-0}\\\\ &amp; =4\\,m\/s. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nNow consider what happens from B to C. There is no change in displacement and so \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{$v$ } &amp; =\\frac{displacement\\;at\\;\\text{C$-displacement\\;at\\;B$ }}{time\\;at\\;\\text{C$-time\\;at\\;\\text{B}$ }}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{8-8}{3-2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{0}{1}\\,m\/s\\\\ &amp; =0\\,m\/s \\end{align*}\\] That is, the object has a velocity of \\(0\\,m\/s\\) between B and C.\r\n\r\nNow consider what happens from C to D. The displacement decreases from \\(8\\) to \\(0\\) over a time of \\(1\\,s.\\) So the velocity is \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{$v$ } &amp; =\\frac{displacement\\;at\\;\\text{D$-displacement\\;at\\;C$ }}{time\\;at\\;\\text{D$-time\\;at\\;\\text{C}$ }}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{0-8}{4-3}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{8}{1}\\\\ &amp; =-8\\,m\/s. \\end{align*}\\] This means the object has reversed (due to the negative sign) its direction and is moving at a SPEED of \\(8\\,m\/s.\\)\r\n\r\nAt D, the object has returned to its starting position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVelocity vs time graphs\r\nThe velocity-time graph below shows a car which accelerates uniformly from rest to \\(60\\,m\/s\\) in \\(20\\,s,\\)then travels at a constant velocity of \\(60\\,m\/s\\) for the next \\(10\\,s\\), then decelerates uniformly to rest in \\(30\\,s.\\) The total journey took \\(60\\,s.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), the object accelerates from \\(0\\,m\/s\\) to \\(60\\,m\/s\\). From \\(B\\) to \\(C\\) the object is moving at a constant velocity of \\(60\\,m\/s\\) and from \\(C\\) to \\(D,\\)the object is slowing down from \\(60\\,m\/s.\\) We now look at some features of the graph in detail. In particular we look at the area under the graph and it\u2019s gradient.\r\n\r\nArea under velocity time graph\r\nConsider the units of the area. The area is the product of the velocity and time and so the units are \\(m\/s\\,\\times s=m.\\) That is, the area under the graph gives displacement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe area under a velocity-time graph gives displacement.\r\n\r\nThe area under a speed-time graph gives distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsider the velocity time graph above. The area has been divided into three regions, \\(1,2\\) and \\(3.\\) Let area of each region be \\(A_{1},A_{2}\\) and \\(A_{3},\\)respectively. We have:4 Remember that the area of a triangle \\(A_{t}\\) is half \\(\\times\\)base \\(\\times\\) height and the area of a rectangle \\(A_{r}\\) is base \\(\\times\\) height. That is, \\[\\begin{align*} A_{t} &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times b\\times h\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}bh\\\\ A_{r} &amp; =b\\times h\\\\ &amp; =bh. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} A_{1} &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times b\\times h\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times20\\times60\\\\ &amp; =600\\,m\\\\ A_{2} &amp; =b\\times h\\\\ &amp; =10\\times60\\\\ &amp; =600\\,m\\\\ A_{3} &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times b\\times h\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times30\\times60\\\\ &amp; =900\\,m. \\end{align*}\\] The total displacement is therefore \\(A_{1}+A_{2}+A_{3}=600+600+900=2100\\,m.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGradient of a velocity-time graph\r\nThe gradient (or slope)5 The gradient \\(m,\\) of a linear (straight line) graph is the rise divided by the run. That is, \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}. \\end{align*}\\] of a Velocity-Time graph gives the acceleration of the object.\r\n\r\nConsider the velocity-time graph above. From \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) the gradient of the graph is \\(m_{AB}\\) where \\[\\begin{align*} m_{AB} &amp; =\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\text{change in velocity}}{\\text{change in time}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{60-0}{20-0}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{60}{20}\\\\ &amp; =3\\,ms^{-2}. \\end{align*}\\] That is, the car is increasing its speed by \\(3\\,m\/s\\) each second.\r\n\r\nFrom \\(B\\) to \\(C\\) the gradient \\[\\begin{align*} m_{BC} &amp; =\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\text{change in velocity}}{\\text{change in time}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{60-60}{30-20}=\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{0}{10}\\\\ &amp; =0\\,ms^{-2}. \\end{align*}\\] That is the car is not accelerating but is moving at a constant velocity of \\(60\\,m\/s.\\)\r\n\r\nFrom \\(C\\) to \\(D\\) the gradient \\[\\begin{align*} m_{CD} &amp; =\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\text{change in velocity}}{\\text{change in time}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{0-60}{60-30}=\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{60}{30}\\\\ &amp; =-2\\,ms^{-2}. \\end{align*}\\] Note the negative value of acceleration indicates the car is slowing down. We say the car is decelerating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther examples\r\n1. A car accelerates from a stationary position. The rate of acceleration is constant6 If acceleration is constant we also use the expression \u201cthe acceleration is uniform\u201d. . Sketch graphs of the acceleration against time, the velocity against time and the displacement against time.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nThe acceleration-time graph is shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is simply a horizontal line as the acceleration is constant.\r\nThe velocity-time graph is shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a linear graph. The gradient (slope) of the graph is the acceleration.\r\nThe displacement-time graph is shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a curve. The gradient (slope) at any point on the curve is the velocity at that time. You can find the approximate value of the gradient by drawing a tangent at the point of interest and then calculating the gradient of the tangent.7 If you know the functional form of the displacement, then you can differentiate it to find the gradient at any time. For example, if \\[\\begin{align*} x\\left(t\\right) &amp; =3t^{2}-2t+1 \\end{align*}\\] then the gradient is \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; =6t-2. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n2. A ball is thrown vertically upwards with a speed of \\(5\\,m\/s\\). Sketch and describe the graph of velocity of the ball against time from the moment it is thrown to the moment it touches the ground. Ignore air resistance.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nFirst define the coordinate system you want to work in. We take upwards velocity as positive and downwards velocity as negative. Once the ball is thrown up, the only force acting on it is gravity which is constant. So from the previous example, the graph of velocity against time is linear. That is, a straight line. As gravity acts downwards, the velocity against time graph must have a negative gradient (because the ball is decelerating). So a velocity-time graph looks like the one below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we need to describe it. Think about what has happened. Initially the ball is thrown into the air vertically upwards (positive direction) with a speed of \\(5\\,m\/s\\). Point \\(A\\) describes the initial velocity (upward) that the ball has. It is \\(5\\,m\/s\\) upward.\r\nThen the ball starts to slow down (due to gravity acting on it). This is the part of the graph from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\). At point \\(B,\\) the ball has zero velocity. It is not moving, and so this is the point of maximum altitude for the ball.\r\nAfter \\(B,\\) the ball has a negative velocity. That means it is now heading downwards towards the point from which it was thrown. Point \\(C\\) represents the starting position. At this point the ball has the same speed8 Speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector. At point \\(A\\) the velocity was \\(5\\,m\/s\\) upward. At point \\(C\\) the velocity is \\(-5\\,m\/s\\) or \\(5\\,m\/s\\) downward. Remember, a vector quantity has to have a magnitude and a direction.  as it had at point \\(A.\\) This is shown in the diagram below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nThe relationships between various graphs and their gradient and the area below them are summarized in the table below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGraph type\r\nDisplacement vs time\r\nVelocity vs time\r\nAcceleration vs time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGradient\r\nVelocity\r\nAcceleration\r\nNo Meaning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArea under graph\r\nNo Meaning\r\nDisplacement\r\nChange in velocity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise\r\n\r\n \tThe graph below shows the position of a dancer moving in a straight line across a stage.\r\nThe dancer\u2019s movements are designated by sections \\(A\\) to \\(D.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tWhat was the starting position of the dancer?\r\n \tIn which of the sections (\\(A\\) - \\(D)\\) is the dancer at rest?\r\n \tIn which of the sections is the dancer moving in a positive direction?\r\n \tIn which of the sections is the dancer moving with a negative velocity?\r\n\r\n\r\n \tThe graph below represents the straight line motion of a radio-controlled toy car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tDescribe, in words, the motion of the car.\r\n \tWhat was the position of the car after i) \\(2\\,s\\) ii) \\(4\\,s\\) iii) \\(6\\,s\\) iv) \\(10\\,s\\) ?\r\n \tAt what time did the car return to its starting point?\r\n \tWhat was the velocity of the car\r\n\\(\\qquad\\)i) during the first \\(2\\,s\\) ?\r\n\\(\\qquad\\)ii) after \\(3\\,s\\) ?\r\n\\(\\qquad\\)iii) from \\(4\\,s\\) to \\(6\\,s\\) ?\r\n\\(\\qquad\\)iv) at \\(8\\,s\\) ?\r\n\\(\\qquad v)\\) from \\(8\\,s\\) to \\(9\\,s\\) ?\r\n\r\n\r\n \tDuring its \\(10\\,s\\) motion, what was the car\u2019s\r\n\\(\\qquad\\)i) distance traveled?\r\n\\(\\qquad\\)ii) displacement?\r\n\r\n\r\n \tThe following position-time graph is for a cyclist traveling along a straight road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tDescribe the motion of the cyclist in words.\r\n \tWhat was the velocity of the cyclist during the first \\(30\\,s\\)?\r\n \tWhat was the cyclist\u2019s velocity during the final \\(10\\,s\\)?\r\n \tCalculate the cyclist\u2019s instantaneous velocity at \\(35\\,s.\\)\r\n \tWhat was the average velocity of the cyclist between \\(30\\,s\\) and \\(40\\,s\\)?\r\n\r\n\r\n \tWhich of the velocity-time graphs \\(A\\) to \\(E\\) best represents the motion of:\r\n\r\n\r\n \ta car coming to a stop at a traffic light?\r\n \ta swimmer moving at a constant speed?\r\n \ta cyclist accelerating from rest with constant acceleration?\r\n \ta car accelerating from rest and changing through its gears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tThe following graph shows the motion of a dog running along a footpath in a northerly direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tDescribe the motion of the dog during these sections of the graph:\r\n\\(\\qquad\\)i) A\\(\\quad\\;\\)ii) B\\(\\quad\\;\\)iii) C\\(\\quad\\;\\)iv) D\\(\\quad\\;\\)v) E\\(\\quad\\;\\)vi) F.\r\n \tCalculate the displacement of the dog after:\r\n\\(\\qquad\\)i) \\(2\\,s\\quad\\;\\)ii) \\(7\\,s\\quad\\;\\)iii) \\(10\\,s.\\)\r\n \tPlot a position-time graph of the dog\u2019s motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n \tThe straight line motion of a train is shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tHow long does the train take to reach its cruising speed?\r\n \tWhat is the acceleration of the train \\(10\\,s\\) after starting.\r\n \tWhat is the acceleration of the train \\(40\\,s\\) after starting?\r\n \tWhat is the displacement of the train after \\(120\\,s\\) ?\r\n\r\nHint for b.9 You can only approximate this.

A vector has both a size (called its magnitude) and a direction. This module explains how vectors may be added together.\r\n\r\nScalars and Vectors\r\nMany physical quantities can be classified into one of two groups: scalars or vectors.\r\n\r\nScalar quantities are completely defined by a magnitude and the relevant unit. For example, a time period may be expressed as 10 seconds. The magnitude is 10, the unit is seconds and there is no direction associated with a time period, so time is a scalar quantity.\r\n\r\nVector quantities require magnitude and direction and the relevant unit. For example, suppose I walk in a Northerly direction for 200 metres. The magnitude is 200, the direction is North and the unit is metres. So my walk is a vector quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\nSome examples of vector and scalar quantities are shown below:\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Quantity\r\nScalar\r\nVector\r\nExample of Unit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime\r\n\\(\\checkmark\\)\r\n\\(\\times\\)\r\nseconds, hours, days, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\ndistance\r\n\\(\\checkmark\\)\r\n\\(\\times\\)\r\ncentimeters, metres, kilometres etc.\r\n\r\n\r\ndisplacement\r\n\\(\\times\\)\r\n\\(\\checkmark\\)\r\n100 metres North, 50 metres in the \\(x\\)-direction\r\n\r\n\r\ntemperature\r\n\\(\\checkmark\\)\r\n\\(\\times\\)\r\n\\(45^{\\circ}\\) Celsius\r\n\r\n\r\nspeed\r\n\\(\\checkmark\\)\r\n\\(\\times\\)\r\n100 kilometres per hour, 3 metres per second\r\n\r\n\r\nvelocity\r\n\\(\\times\\)\r\n\\(\\checkmark\\)\r\n100 kilometres per hour, South; 3 \\(ms^{-1}\\) parallel to the \\(y-\\)axis\r\n\r\n\r\nvoltage\r\n\\(\\checkmark\\)\r\n\\(\\times\\)\r\n250 millivolts DC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRepresenting Vector Quantities\r\nVectors are drawn by an arrow, whose length varies with the magnitude of the vector (drawn to scale!) and which points in the appropriate direction. For example, suppose North is up the page, South is down, East is to the right and West is to the left. \\(A\\) vector from a point \\(A\\) to a point \\(B\\) (East of \\(A\\)) representing a distance of 10 metres could be shown as in the diagram below1 We call \\(A\\) the tail of the vector and \\(B\\) the head of the vector., East is assumed to be positive so the arrow points towards \\(B\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the same scale, a vector representing a distance of 2 metres to the west of A could be represented by:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning and end of a vector may be identified by letters such as \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as above. In such cases the vector may be referred to as \\(\\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}\\). The arrow above the letters signifies that the quantity \\(AB\\) is a vector but does not point in the direction of the vector.\r\n\r\nIf we wanted a vector of magnitude 10 meters pointing West it would look like:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis vector is referred to as \\(\\overrightarrow{BA\\,\\,}.\\) Note that \\[ \\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}=-\\overrightarrow{BA\\,\\,}. \\] In other words, multiplying a vector by \\(-1\\) changes the direction of the vector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMagnitude of a Vector\r\nSometimes we want to use only the magnitude (size) of a particular vector. In such cases, to distinguish that it is only the magnitude that is being used, we use the modulus sign \\(\\left|\\right|\\). So for the vector \\(\\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}\\) above we would have \\[ \\left|\\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}\\right|=10\\textrm{ metres} \\] as \\(\\overrightarrow{AB\\,}\\) represented a distance of 10 metres to the East.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tThe magnitude of a vector representing a velocity of 30 \\(\\textrm{ms}^{-1}\\)in a southerly direction is 30 \\(\\textrm{ms}^{-1}\\).\r\n \tThe magnitude of a force of 18 Newtons in a Westerly direction is 18 Newtons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdding Vectors\r\nTwo vectors are added by placing the tail of the second vector at the head off the first and drawing an arrow from the tail of the first to the head of the second. For example we will add a vector that is 2 metres to the east to another vector that is 5 metres to the east. The two vectors to be added together are shown in red and the resulting vector is shown in blue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can write this algebraically as: \\[ \\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}+\\overrightarrow{CD\\,\\,}=\\overrightarrow{AD\\,\\,}. \\] The vector \\(\\overrightarrow{AD\\,\\,}\\) is called the resultant and in this case is a vector of magnitude 7 metres in an Easterly direction.\r\n\r\nWe can also add vectors that are in North and South directions. For example if we add a vector representing 2 metres South to a vector representing 4 meters North we get:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that the vector to the South is shown pointing downwards as we assume North is up. The result is a vector (shown in red) of length 2 meters pointing North. We could write this as\r\n\r\n\\[ \\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}+\\overrightarrow{CD\\,\\,}=\\overrightarrow{AD\\,\\,} \\] as before.\r\n\r\nNow add a vector of 3 meters to the North to another of 4 meters to the East:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resultant vector \\(\\overrightarrow{BD\\,\\,}\\) is shown in red. It\u2019s magnitude may be found using Pythagoras\u2019s Theorem:2 Note that the angle \\(\\widehat{BCD}\\) or \\(\\widehat{BAD}\\) is 90 degrees and so Pythagoras\u2019s Theorem can be used.  \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|\\overrightarrow{BD\\,\\,}\\right| &amp; =\\sqrt{\\left|\\overrightarrow{BA\\,\\,}\\right|^{2}+\\left|\\overrightarrow{CD\\,\\,}\\right|^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{9+16}\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{25}\\\\ &amp; =5. \\end{align*}\\] The direction my be found by calculating the angle \\(\\widehat{CBD}\\). That is \\[\\begin{align*} \\widehat{CBD} &amp; =\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\left|\\overrightarrow{CD\\,\\,}\\right|}{\\left|\\overrightarrow{AB\\,\\,}\\right|}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =53.13^{\\circ}. \\end{align*}\\] So the resultant vector has a magnitude of 5 metres in a direction North \\(53.13\\) degrees East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\n1.(a) To \\(\\overrightarrow{60\\,\\,}\\)km East, add \\(\\overrightarrow{25\\,\\,}\\)km East\\(\\quad\\)(b) To \\(\\overrightarrow{60\\,\\,}\\)km East, add \\(\\overrightarrow{25\\,\\,}\\)km West.\r\n2.(a) To \\(\\overrightarrow{30\\,\\,}\\)km West, add \\(\\overrightarrow{40\\,\\,}\\)km North\\(\\quad\\)(b) To \\(\\overrightarrow{30\\,\\,}\\)km West, add \\(\\overrightarrow{30\\,\\,}\\)km South.\r\n3.

We are programmed to eagerly anticipate the next technological development, the next philosophical shift, the next cause of political and social outrage\u2026\r\n\r\nWe have lost the ability to be satisfied with what we have right now and to understand how good we truly have it. Spend five minutes on social media and you will be bombarded with a tidal wave of discontent. Everyone, it seems, has something to complain about.\r\n\r\nUnless you have been living under a rock, you will have heard of phenomena such as \u2018cancel culture\u2019 and \u2018me too\u2019- if you are more unfortunate, you may even have been \u2018cancelled\u2019 yourself. A recent study from a prominent Australian university discovered that the emotional toll of being \u2018cancelled\u2019 is causing every-day Australians severe anguish. In fact, the study revealed that 78.7% of people are so worried that they will be \u2018cancelled\u2019 that they are now fearful to speak their minds in a public forum.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why the VCP will be introducing a bill to Parliament this week that proposes changes to our current Freedom of Speech laws. The changes would remove penalties for harmless comments about people\u2019s physical attributes, their personal beliefs and their cultural background.\r\n\r\nMany experts in the area of anthropology have identified that countries where people have to watch their words carefully have higher rates of depression. Our proposed laws will bring this country back to being a happy country where people can speak without consequences.\r\n\r\nThe time has come to act. Our country is being overrun by wannabe socialists with left-leaning political agenda. We urge you to petition your local member of Parliament to support our bill before decent conservative-minded Australians like you and I are no longer able to live our lives the way we always have.\r\n\r\nTogether we can stop the nonsense. Join us and we can get this country back on track.\r\nPersuasive language analysis\r\nThe author of The cost of change uses a number of persuasive techniques to influence the reader, such as:\r\n\r\n \tEmotional appeal: The author taps into feelings of nostalgia and fear, suggesting that people are losing satisfaction with the direction of society by mentioning \"severe anguish\" and \"fearful to speak\".\r\n \tBandwagon: Phrases like \"unless you have been living under a rock\" suggest that the issues are universally acknowledged, encouraging readers to align with the majority.\r\n \tStatistics: The use of a specific percentage (78.7%) from a \"recent study\" attempts to add credibility. However, the specific source is not mentioned, and the author tells us the information came from a \"prominent Australian university.\"\r\n \tAppeal to authority: The article references \"many experts in the area of anthropology\" to support the argument but does not mention who the experts are.\r\n \tFear of consequences: The text warns of a \"left-leaning political agenda\" and suggests that conservative values are under threat, urging immediate action.\r\n \tCall to action: The author strongly encourages readers to \"petition your local member of Parliament,\" creating a sense of urgency.\r\n \tRidicule\/attack: The term \"wannabe socialists\" is used to ridicule and discredit opponents, framing them as a threat to traditional values. The phrase \u201ceveryone has something to complain about\u201d suggests that people who do not hold the same view as the author somehow lack resilience.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Understanding how the persuasive language authors use can help us to understand their potential motivations and biases.

Understanding these can help you make more informed choices in your research.\r\n\r\n \tOpinion pieces: These are based on personal views and may lack factual support. For example, a blog post about climate change without scientific evidence. When reading opinion pieces, keep in mind who the author is if they have any strong beliefs or affiliations which could lead to bias.\r\n \tOutdated sources: Information from a decade ago might not reflect current knowledge. This is particularly the case in medical and technology fields.\r\n \tAnecdotal pieces: These rely on personal stories rather than data. For example, websites that make claims about conspiracies may not list their sources about where their information has come from and should be treated with caution.\r\n \tUnverified online sources: Websites without credibility checks. For example, a random wiki page edited by anyone.\r\n \tNon-peer-reviewed articles: Articles that haven\u2019t been evaluated by experts, for example, a self-published paper on a complex scientific topic, should also be treated with caution. This is because the way that the study was conducted, the results and the interpretation of the results have not been checked and verified by industry experts.\r\n \tAssumptions: These are ideas presented without evidence. For example, if I assume that all students learn the same way without considering individual differences, this can weaken my argument.\r\n\r\nStrong evidence\r\nStrong information sources provide reliable, relevant, and well-supported data that makes your work more convincing. Below are some key types of strong information sources to guide you in selecting the most effective materials for your research.\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tPeer-reviewed journal articles: These articles undergo evaluation by experts in the field, ensuring accuracy and validity. For example, a research article published in well-respected journals like\u202fNature\u202for\u202fThe Lancet.\r\n \tGovernment data and official reports: These sources offer authoritative and reliable information. For instance, the Australian Bureau of Statistics provides comprehensive data on demographics and economic indicators, which can be crucial for evidence-based research.\r\n \tBooks by experts: Authored by recognised authorities, these books provide in-depth analysis and insights. An example is a comprehensive text on economics by a renowned economist.\r\n \tAcademic conference papers: These are often peer-reviewed and they usually present current research and developments. For example, recordings from the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence could be a strong source of information for students of information technology subjects.\r\n \tReputable news outlets: Articles from news sources that are known for fact-checking and reliability, such as articles from the ABC, the BBC or The Guardian, often offer well-researched information.\r\n\r\nResponding to authors' claims\r\nWhile you read books and articles or watch videos to find information for your assignments, remember to think about how the authors support their claims. Are they using evidence from reputable sources or are they relying on unchecked sources and assumptions?\r\n\r\nOnce you have found information that you would like to cite in your work, here are some techniques that can be used. In these examples, the writer will use weak points on which to base their counter arguments and strong points to support their argument.\r\nConcession + counter claim\r\nExample: Admittedly, there are benefits Bako\u2019s (2022) plan for overhauling the education system. However, they do not justify the costs that will be worn by taxpayers.\r\n\r\nRefute with evidence\r\nExample: Cienfuegos (2024) claims that intermittent fasting can reduce inflammation. This is despite a lack of support from recent empirical studies.\r\n\r\nAcknowledge opposing views\r\nExample: A number of academics (Daalman, 2021; Aronov &amp; Weller, 2021; Stojanovski 2019) are of the view that an excess of sugar can cause hyperactivity in children, a new study by Zapatero (2024) shows that this may not be the case.\r\n\r\nIdentify a lack of evidence\r\nExample: Whittaker (2023) does not provide support their claim with evidence from a reliable source.\r\n\r\nComparative analysis\r\nExample: Smith (2020) uses anecdotal evidence from a personal experience to conclude that positive education is completely ineffective. On the other hand, Christopoulos (2023) conducted a systematic review that shows that positive education can be an effective classroom tool.","excerpt":"Selecting credible sources for your assignments enhances the quality and reliability of your work, making your arguments more persuasive and impactful.

Brackets are useful to group numbers, pronumerals and operations together as a whole. Whatever is around the brackets affects all the things inside the brackets.\r\n\r\nBrackets are commonly used to express mathematical formulae. In order to manipulate expressions containing brackets it is necessary to remove them first. This module discusses how to remove brackets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distributive law\r\n\r\nIn what follow we will write \\(a\\left(b+c\\right)\\) which means \\(a\\times\\left(b+c\\right)\\). That is the \\(a\\) multiplies the bracket. We usually don\u2019t include the times sign \\(\\left(\\times\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nThe distributive law says that \\[\\begin{align*} a\\left(b+c\\right) &amp; =ab+ac. \\end{align*}\\] In words, the \\(a\\) outside the bracket multiplies everything inside the bracket.\r\n\r\nFor example, \\[\\begin{align*} 2\\left(3+5\\right) &amp; =2\\times3+2\\times5. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nRemoving the brackets is called expansion.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tExpand \\(3\\left(x+2\\right)\\). We have \\[\\begin{align*} 3\\left(x+2\\right) &amp; =3\\times x+3\\times2\\\\ &amp; =3x+6. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand \\(-5\\left(m+4\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} -5\\left(m+4\\right) &amp; =\\left(-5\\right)\\times m+\\left(-5\\right)\\times4\\\\ &amp; =-5m-20. \\end{align*}\\] Usually we omit the first step shown above and expand directly as shown in the following examples.\r\n \tExpand \\(-2\\left(p-7\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} -2\\left(p-7\\right) &amp; =-2p+14. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand \\(e\\left(e+2\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} e\\left(e+2\\right) &amp; =e^{2}+2e. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand \\(-\\left(4p-3\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} -\\left(4p-3\\right) &amp; =-4p+3. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand and simplify \\(4\\left(x-3\\right)+2\\left(x+1\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} 4\\left(x-3\\right)+2\\left(x+1\\right) &amp; =4x-12+2x+2\\\\ &amp; =6x-10. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tExpand and simplify \\(6k\\left(2k+3\\right)-3k\\left(k-3\\right).\\) We have \\[\\begin{align*} 6k\\left(2k+3\\right)-3k\\left(k-3\\right) &amp; =12k^{2}+18k-3k^{2}+9k\\\\ &amp; =9k^{2}+27k. \\end{align*}\\] Now do some practice. See Exercise \\(1\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBinomial products\r\nA binomial product is something like \\(\\left(m+2\\right)\\left(m+3\\right).\\) It is the product of two binomial terms.1 A binomial term is an expression involving two terms. Examples are: \\(a+3\\), \\(1+c,\\) \\(a+b,\\) and \\(\\left(3x+2y\\right)\\). \r\n\r\nTo expand the two brackets, multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket.

This is a short movie on removing brackets in algebra.\r\n\r\nThe law that allows us to expand expressions with brackets in maths is called the distributive law. For instance, A brackets B plus C, is the same as A times B plus A times C, you're multiplying the term outside the brackets by the term inside the brackets, an alternate way of writing A times brackets B plus C, same thing, A times B plus A times C.\r\n\r\nBefore we get into some of the examples just recall some of our work we've done in the past, multiplying positive and negative numbers. Remember if the signs are the same, plus plus or minus minus the answer is positive, if the signs are different, plus and minus, then the answer is negative.\r\n\r\nSo let's use this law and multiply out this particular expression just with numbers; two times brackets three plus five, so we're going two times three plus two times five, two times three is six, two times five is ten, answer is 16. Let's look at another example but here we're using algebra; three brackets X plus two, we use the same law again, three times X plus three times two, which is three X plus six, notice we can't add three X to six because the terms are different. Similarly with negative signs, minus five brackets M plus four gives us minus five times M plus minus five times four, which is minus five M minus 20, the terms are different so they must be left alone. And finally, with two negative signs, so be careful here, minus two brackets P minus seven is minus two times P plus minus two times minus seven, which is minus two P plus 14.\r\n\r\nLet's now move on with two sets of brackets, four brackets M minus three plus two brackets M plus one. We use the same ideas as before giving us four M minus 12 plus two M plus two, collect the like terms and we've got six M minus 10. Similarly, two sets of brackets but this time we have to be really careful because there's a negative sign. Minus six X brackets two X plus three minus three X brackets X minus three gives us minus 12 X squared minus 18 X minus 3 X squared and there it is we've got plus 9 X at the end, two negatives give us a positive, collecting up the like terms we've got minus 15 X squared minus 9 X.\r\n\r\nNow let's looked at two sets of brackets that are placed side by side, in other words we're multiplying the first set of brackets by the second set of brackets. And if you look at the example in blue the idea is to multiply the first term in the first set of brackets by the second set of brackets and the second term in the first set of brackets by the second set of brackets, in other words X multiplied by X plus three plus two multiplied by X plus three. If we expand these brackets further we have X squared plus three X plus two X plus six and collecting the like terms gives us an answer of A squared plus five X plus six.\r\n\r\nHere are two more examples that have been written out for you. The one in blue at the top, notice there's a negative sign so be careful here with the negative signs, giving us an answer of M squared minus M minus 20 and the example in red there are two negative signs here, so be doubly careful when multiplying out these sets of brackets, giving us an answer of Q squared minus nine Q plus 18.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself. The answers to these problems are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"What do I do with the brackets? Brackets are useful to group numbers, pronumerals and operations together as a whole. Whatever is around the brackets affects all the things inside the brackets. Brackets are commonly used to express mathematical formulae. In order to manipulate expressions containing brackets it is necessary to remove them first. This module discusses how to remove brackets. The distributive law In what follow we will write \\(a\\left(b+c\\right)\\) which means \\(a\\times\\left(b+c\\right)\\). That is the \\(a\\) multiplies the bracket. We usually don\u2019t include the times sign \\(\\left(\\times\\right)\\). The distributive law says that \\[\\begin{align*} a\\left(b+c\\right) &amp; =ab+ac. \\end{align*}\\] In [&hellip;]","date":"16 October 2023","link":"\/maths-statistics\/algebra\/a13-removing-brackets\/","keywords":["Algebra","Arithmetic","Functions","Maths equations"]},{"id":2965,"title":"A1.1: Algebraic operations","content":"Introducing the basic skills for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (+ - \u00d7 \u00f7) of algebraic expressions.

For example, \\(3x\\) is a pro-numeral. In algebra, when we write \\(3x\\) we really mean \\(3\\times x\\). Another example of a pro-numeral is \\(5ab\\). This means \\(5\\times a\\times b\\). Note that \\(5ab=5ba\\). The order of the letters and numbers is not important but usually we write numbers first and use alphabetical order for the letters. While \\(5ba\\) is correct, it is more common to write \\(5ab\\).

Usually the order in which we perform the operations is important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, what is the answer to the following arithmetic problem \\[ 4+3\\times2+5\\;? \\] At first sight there are several possible answers.\r\n\r\nWorking from left to right we get: \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =7\\times2+5\\\\ &amp; =14+5\\\\ &amp; =19. \\end{align*}\\] Working from right to left we get: \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =4+3\\times7\\\\ &amp; =4+21\\\\ &amp; =25. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nIf we do the multiplication first we get another answer: \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =4+6+5\\\\ &amp; =15. \\end{align*}\\] Yet another answer is obtained by doing the additions first: \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =7\\times7\\\\ &amp; =49. \\end{align*}\\] Mathematicians don\u2019t like imprecision. In order to allow only one answer to the problem we perform operations in the following order:\r\n\r\n \tBrackets\r\n \tIndices\r\n \tMultiplication and Division from left to right\r\n \tAddition and Subtraction\r\n\r\nUsing the first letters (bold) we get the abbreviation BIMDAS.\r\n\r\nApplying this rule the answer to our problem is \\[\\begin{align*} 4+3\\times2+5 &amp; =4+6+5\\quad\\textrm{multiplication first}\\\\ &amp; =15\\quad\\textrm{then addition}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \t\\(3\\times2+4=6+4=10.\\)\r\n \t\\(3+2\\times4=3+8=11\\).\r\n \t\\(\\left(3+2\\right)\\times4=5\\times4=20.\\)\r\n \t\\(3-2^{2}=3-2\\times2=3-4=-1\\).\r\n \t\\(\\left(3-2\\right)^{2}=\\left(3-2\\right)\\times\\left(3-2\\right)=1\\times1=1\\).\r\n \t\\(3^{2}-2^{2}=3\\times3-2\\times2=9-4=5\\).\r\n \t\\(3st-3s\\times4t=3st-12st=-9st\\).\r\n\r\nFor some practice, see Exercise 4.\r\nExercises\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 1\r\nWhich of the five terms on the right is a like term with the term on the left?\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{llllllll} 1) &amp; 3x &amp; | &amp; 3 &amp; 2x &amp; 3x^{2} &amp; 2xy &amp; 4x^{2}a\\\\ 2) &amp; 2ab &amp; | &amp; 2a &amp; 2b &amp; 3x^{2} &amp; 6abc &amp; 12ab\\\\ 3) &amp; 2x^{2} &amp; | &amp; x &amp; 2x &amp; 5x^{2} &amp; 4x &amp; 4x^{3}\\\\ 4) &amp; 3xy^{2} &amp; | &amp; 3 &amp; 3xy &amp; 3x^{2}xy^{2} &amp; 3y^{2} &amp; y^2x\\\\ 5) &amp; 2m^{2}n &amp; | &amp; n &amp; mn^{2} &amp; 8mn &amp; 2m^{2} &amp; 4nm^{2}\\\\ 6) &amp; 4ab^{2}c &amp; | &amp; 4 &amp; 2ab^{2}c &amp; 4abc &amp; 8b^{2}c &amp; 4cba \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 2\r\nSimplify each of the following:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lllllll} &amp; &amp; a)\\;13x+4-3x-1 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; b)\\;10mn+5m+12mn+6m\\\\ &amp; &amp; c)\\;3xy^{2}+2xy+5xy^{2}+3xy &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; d)\\;5xy+6m-2xy-2m\\\\ &amp; &amp; e)\\;x+y+2x-y &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; f)\\;3a+5b-a-6b\\\\ &amp; &amp; g)\\;x+4y-x-2y &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; h)\\;7x-4m-5x-3m\\\\ &amp; &amp; i)\\;4x-5x-3y+5x &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; j)\\;9mn-3m-n+4m^{2} \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 3\r\nSimplify the following algebraic expressions:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lllllll} 1. &amp; &amp; a)\\;5\\times2k &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; b)\\;4a\\times3ab\\\\ &amp; &amp; c)\\;y\\times3y &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; d)\\;4m\\times\\left(-3mn\\right)\\\\ &amp; &amp; e)\\;m\\times39\\times5 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; f)\\;2ab\\times3bc\\times\\left(-4\\right)\\\\ &amp; &amp; g)\\;2ab^{2}\\times3ac &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; h)\\;4m\\times\\left(-5kmp\\right)\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ 2. &amp; &amp; a)\\;18ef\\div6f &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; b)\\;-100uvw\\div100w\\\\ &amp; &amp; c)\\;24gh^{2}\\div8gh &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; d)\\;3m^{2}n\\div12mn^{2}\\\\ &amp; &amp; e)\\;rs\\times2st\\div2s &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; f)\\;3jk\\times12km\\div9jkm\\\\ &amp; &amp; g)\\;10p\\times3qp\\div16pq &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; h)\\;4yz\\times5w^{2}z\\div10wy \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 4\r\nSimplify the following expressions:\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{array}{lllll} 1)\\;18+\\left(3\\times\\left(-5\\right)\\right) &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 2)\\;3\\times\\left(-4\\right)+\\left(8\\times2\\right)\\\\ 3)\\;10-5^{2}+3 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 4)\\;\\left(10-5\\right)^{2}+3\\\\ 5)\\;10^{2}-5^{2} &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 6)\\;\\left(10-5\\right)^{2}\\\\ 7)\\;3m+2\\times3m &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 8)\\;6ab-3a\\times4b\\\\ 9)\\;16gh-4gh\\times4 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 10)\\;9b-3b\\times2k+2k\\times b \\end{array}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nM: Hi, this is Martin Lindsay from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. This is a short movie on operations with algebra. First of all make sure you can tell the difference between like terms and unlike terms. Like terms contain exactly the same pro-numerals, in other words letters or variables, so look at the like terms down the left hand column and compare them with the unlike terms in the right hand column, in particular look at the last term, seven E F and eight F E, they are in fact like terms. Only like terms can be added or subtracted. For instance, in this example, seven E plus 10 E, the terms are alike, therefore they can be added to give you 17 E. But look at this one, be careful because here we have two terms, the X squared term and the X term so we have to add them separately, so three X squared minus X squared minus four X squared gives us minus two X squared, and two X, which is different to the X squared term must be left alone so the answer is minus two X squared plus two X.Similarly if you look at this example in red, there's a U V term which is the same as V U and that is different to the U term therefore that gives us minus two U V plus three U, we keep them separate, we can't add minus two U V to three U. And finally six R squared S minus two R S squared, they look similar but they are not the same, these are two unlike terms so we can't simplify this expression.Now before we move on to multiplying and dividing algebraic terms make sure you are familiar with the multiplication and dividing of positive and negative numbers on this slide. So study this carefully before moving onto the next slide.\r\n\r\nBut let's multiply some pro-numerals. Here's the first example, minus four times three B, multiply the numbers together, minus four and minus three gives you plus 12 and then just tag on the B afterwards so the answer is 12 B. Here's another one, multiply out the numbers first, three times minus 15 gives you minus 15, now multiply the pro-numeral, E and E squared is E cubed, so the answer is minus 15 E cubed.\r\n\r\nThe next example in red multiply out, as before, the numbers, minus two times minus four is plus eight, then the pro-numerals, there's a U squared term and there are Vs there, V times V is a V squared, so the answer is eight U squared V squared. Notice in these examples that because we're multiplying the actual terms can be different, so make sure you know the difference between adding and subtracting where the pro\u2011numerals must be exactly the same, multiplying and dividing the pro-numerals can be different.\r\n\r\nFinally minus three P Q times minus two Q times P, multiply out the numbers, that gives you plus six, P times P is P squared, Q times Q is Q squared, so the answer is six P squared Q squared. Now in this slide we're dividing pro-numerals, so the first term minus 12 W Y Z divided by the second term three Y Z, express that as a fraction first and look for terms that will cancel top and bottom, in this case the Ys cancel top and bottom and the Zs cancel top and bottom, notice three will divide into 12 four times, so the answer is minus four W.\r\n\r\nHere's another one slightly more complicated. Now in this slide we're dividing pro\u2011numerals, so the first term minus 12 W Y Z divided by the second term three Y Z, express that as a fraction first and look for terms that will cancel top and bottom, in this case the Ys cancel top and bottom and the Zs cancel top and bottom, notice three will divide into 12 four times so the answer is minus four W.\r\n\r\nHere's another one slightly more complicated. Writing it as a fraction, minus two M squared N over six M N squared, and then in the third term I've expanded the M squared so it's M times N and then I've tacked the N on the end of that and I've done the same thing with the denominator with N squared N times N, so you can clearly see where the Ms and the Ns cancel, giving you an answer of minus M over three N. Notice minus on the top divided by plus on the bottom gives you an answer of minus.\r\n\r\nAnd finally in blue there's a multiplication and a division so you again express that as a fraction, expand the A squared and then cancel top and bottom terms giving you an answer of two A. Now we'll move on to some slightly harder problems with algebra, but notice the rule that we use first of all, in other words if an expression has brackets in it that must be done first, secondly if there are indices you do that next, thirdly you do multiplying and dividing and lastly you do adding and subtraction.\r\n\r\nSo let's do some examples. Three S T minus three S times four T, notice we have a negative sign and a multiplication sign, so the times is worked out first, so three S times four T is 12 S T, notice now we have subtraction, three S T minus 12 S T, notice the terms are alike therefore we can subtract them, three minus 12 is minus nine S T.\r\n\r\nLet's look at this one. We've got two terms in brackets and a division, so the brackets are worked out first, even though there's a plus inside the brackets must be worked out first, which gives us six X Y, then we divide that by two X, express that as a fraction, cancel any terms, Xs cancel here, twos go into six three times so the answer is three Y.\r\n\r\nAnd finally look at this one. We have brackets, multiplication, addition and division. So the brackets is worked out first, that gives as minus 10 A squared B squared in the second line, then I write out the rest, plus two A cubed B cubed divided by A B, what do we do next, well we have division which becomes ... comes before addition, therefore we divide the two A cubed B cubed by A B, writing that as a fraction, simplifying by cancelling like terms and then in the final line we've just got two terms which we can add together. Notice again that the terms are exactly the same, A squared B squared, therefore we can add them, minus 10 plus two gives us minus eight A squared B squared.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide.

This is a short movie on adding and subtracting algebraic fractions. Let's start by looking at a simple fraction, 18 over 24. Notice that 18 and 24 are divisible by six, six into 18 goes three, six into 24 goes four; we say that 18 and 24 have a common factor of six, so the answer is three quarters. Similarly 120 over 70 is divisible by 10, in other words 120 and 70 have a common factor of 10, that gives us an answer of 12 over seven.\r\n\r\nDon't forget that only fractions that have a common denominator can be added or subtracted. For instance, in this case, seven tenths minus three sevenths, the common denominator here is 70, in other words 10 will divide into 70 and so will seven, so we have to carry out that process shown on the screen. At the bottom of the slide we are now subtracting these two fractions to give us an answer of 19 over 70.\r\n\r\nNow let's move on to algebraic fractions. Again we're using the same idea as with normal fractions. Here we have H over six plus two H over nine, notice that the six and nine are different so we need a common denominator which, in this case, is 18 and thus we go through the process of adding two algebraic fractions with a common denominator of 18. Once we get to the bottom of our problem we then add the two terms up, three H plus four H which gives us seven H, notice the terms here are alike.\r\n\r\nHere's another example, E plus one over two plus E over five, two and five must divide into a number, the common denominator here would have to be 10 so that equals E plus one over two times five over five plus E over five times two over two. Notice the next line down we have brackets, E plus one, be careful here we're multiplying five by E plus one, so it's five brackets E plus one plus two E over 10. Once we expand the brackets we get five E plus five plus two E, that gives us seven E plus five. Notice I'm adding the like terms together and there are two different terms here, an E term and a number, which is five.\r\n\r\nNow let's look at subtracting algebraic fractions, five over two A minus three over four, so we need a common denominator, a number, that both two A and four will divide into. So four A will be that common denominator so we'd need to multiply two A by two and four by A to get our common denominator of four A. Then we have in the bottom line of our slide 10 minus three A, notice here that the terms are different so we can't do anything about them, we leave them alone, so the answer is 10 minus three A over four A.\r\n\r\nNow try some questions for yourselves. The answers to these problems are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"How do I deal with fractions involving pronumerals?

The numerator (top) or denominator (bottom) of a fraction can be in algebraic form involving numbers and variables (represented by pronumerals or letters). We cover the multiplication and division of fractions containing algebraic terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimplifying fractions\r\n\r\nYou have probably seen numerical fractions like \\(\\frac{18}{24}\\) before. Generally we like to reduce fractions to their simplest form. This is done by dividing the numerator and denominator by the same number.1 The numerator is the number on top and the denominator is the number at the bottom of the fraction.\r\n\r\nSo \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{18}{24} &amp; =\\frac{9}{12}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ numbers\\ by\\ two}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{4}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ numbers\\ by\\ three} \\end{alignat*}\\] this is the simplest form as there is no number that divides into \\(3\\) and \\(4\\). Note that this can be done in one step if you realise that \\(6\\) divides into \\(18\\) and \\(24\\). Then you have \\[ \\frac{18}{24}=\\frac{3}{4}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ numbers\\ by\\ six.} \\] Simplifying fractions by dividing the same number into both the numerator and denominator is called cancelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimplifying algebraic fractions\r\nWe can use the same technique to simplify algebraic fractions as we did in simplifying numerical fractions. For example:\r\n\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{4x^{2}y}{6y^{2}}\\).\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{4x^{2}y}{6y^{2}} &amp; =\\frac{2x^{2}y}{3y^{2}}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by\\ two}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2x^{2}}{3y}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by}\\:y. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{a(b+2c)}{2ab}.\\)\r\nThis example shows it is important to divide all terms on the top by the same number.2 Note that you cannot divide the \\(2c\\) on top and the \\(2b\\) on the bottom by \\(2\\). This is because all the terms on the top and bottom have to be divided by \\(2\\). So it would be wrong to write \\[ \\frac{b+2c}{2b}=\\frac{b+c}{b} \\] because the \\(b\\) on the top line was not divided by \\(2\\). \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{a(b+2c)}{2ab} &amp; =\\frac{(b+2c)}{2b}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by}\\:a\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{b+2c}{2b}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{m-n}{\\left(m-n\\right)^{2}}\\). 3 This example uses the fact that \\(\\left(m-n\\right)^{2}=\\left(m-n\\right)\\left(m-n\\right)\\). Since \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are just numbers, \\(m-n\\) is also a number and so we can divide by \\(m-n\\) provided that \\(m\\neq n\\). If \\(m=n\\), \\(m-n=0\\) and we mustn\u2019t divide anything by zero. \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{m-n}{\\left(m-n\\right)^{2}} &amp; =\\frac{m-n}{\\left(m-n\\right)\\left(m-n\\right)}\\quad\\left(m\\neq n\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{m-n}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by}\\:m-n. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{3x^{2}y}{6x+9y}.\\) 4 This example factorizes the denominator first. We then divide the top and bottom of the fraction by the common factor \\(3\\).  \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{3x^{2}y}{6x+9y} &amp; =\\frac{3x^{2}y}{3\\left(2x+3y\\right)}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{taking\\:out}\\ the\\;factor\\;of\\:3\\ in\\ the\\:denominator}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{x^{2}y}{2x+3y}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by}\\:3. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{p-2}{\\left(6p-3p^{2}\\right)}.\\) 5 This example uses the fact that \\(p-2=-\\left(2-p\\right).\\) \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{p-2}{\\left(6p-3p^{2}\\right)} &amp; =\\frac{p-2}{3\\left(2p-p^{2}\\right)}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{taking\\:out}\\ the\\;factor\\;of\\:3\\ in\\ the\\:denominator}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{p-2}{3p\\left(2-p\\right)}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{taking\\:out}\\ the\\;factor\\;of\\:\\mathit{p}\\ in\\ the\\:denominator}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{p-2}{3p\\left(p-2\\right)}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{using\\;\\mathit{p-\\mathrm{2}=-\\left(\\mathrm{2}-p\\right)}}}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{1}{3p}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ by}\\:p-2. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that you can only divide the denominator and numerator if ALL the terms have a common factor. For example, it would be WRONG to write \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{x+2}{2y} &amp; =\\frac{x+1}{y} \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\nbecause the \\(x\\) in the top line has not been divided by 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo practice these techniques, please look at Exercise 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplying fractions\r\nWhen we multiply two fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators of each fraction. For example, \\[ \\frac{3}{4}\\times\\frac{7}{5}=\\frac{21}{20}. \\]\r\n\r\nIt is best to simplify each fraction, if possible, before you do the multiplication. For example, \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{15}{8}\\times\\frac{24}{35} &amp; =\\frac{15}{1}\\times\\frac{3}{35}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\;24\\:in\\:the\\:top\\:line\\:and\\:the\\:8\\:in\\:the\\:bottom\\:line\\:by\\:8}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{1}\\times\\frac{3}{7}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\;15\\:in\\:the\\:top\\:line\\:and\\:the\\:35\\:in\\:the\\:bottom\\:line\\:by\\:5}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{9}{7}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplying algebraic fractions\r\nYou can also use these ideas with algebraic fractions. For example, \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{5a}{7}\\times\\frac{14}{a} &amp; =\\frac{5}{7}\\times\\frac{14}{1}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\;5\\mathit{a}\\:in\\:the\\:top\\:line\\:and\\:the\\:\\mathit{a}\\:in\\:the\\:bottom\\:line\\:by\\:\\mathit{a}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5}{1}\\times\\frac{2}{1}\\quad\\:\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\;14\\:in\\:the\\:top\\:line\\:and\\:the\\:\\mathit{7}\\:in\\:the\\:bottom\\:line\\:by\\:\\mathit{7}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{10}{1}\\\\ &amp; =10. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\nHere are some more examples:6 Note that we are showing every step in the examples below and so the solutions may appear long and complicated. You don\u2019t have to do this. You can take as many steps as you like. As you get more familiar with algebra you will naturally use fewer steps to get a result.\r\n\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{x}{6\\left(x-2\\right)}\\times\\frac{3\\left(x-2\\right)}{x^{2}}\\). \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{x}{6\\left(x-2\\right)}\\times\\frac{3\\left(x-2\\right)}{x^{2}} &amp; =\\frac{x}{6}\\times\\frac{3}{x^{2}}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\:lines\\:by\\:\\mathit{x-2}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{x}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\:lines\\:by\\:\\mathit{3}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{x}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\:lines\\:by\\:\\mathit{x}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2x}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{3m+12}{10}\\times\\frac{5}{m^{2}+4m}.\\) \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{3m+12}{10}\\times\\frac{5}{m^{2}+4m} &amp; =\\frac{3\\left(m+4\\right)}{10}\\times\\frac{5}{m^{2}+4m}\\quad\\mathrm{taking\\:out\\:a\\:factor\\:of\\:\\mathit{3}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3\\left(m+4\\right)}{10}\\times\\frac{5}{m\\left(m+4\\right)}\\quad\\mathrm{taking\\:out\\:a\\:factor\\:of\\:\\mathit{m}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{10}\\times\\frac{5}{m}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\:by\\:\\mathit{m+4}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{m}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:the\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\:lines\\:by\\:\\mathit{5}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{2m}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDividing fractions\r\nThe reciprocal of a fraction is just the fraction turned upside down. So the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) is \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) and the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{2}{7}\\) is \\(\\frac{7}{2}\\). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal.7 When dividing fractions we change the divide sign to times and turn the last fraction upside down.\r\n\r\nFor example: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{5}{4}\\div\\frac{19}{8} &amp; =\\frac{5}{4}\\times\\frac{8}{19}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5}{1}\\times\\frac{2}{19}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{10}{19}. \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDividing algebraic fractions\r\nWe use the same technique for dividing algebraic fractions as we use for dividing numerical fractions.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{7p}{12}\\div\\frac{3}{8}.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{7p}{12}\\div\\frac{3}{8} &amp; =\\frac{7p}{12}\\times\\frac{8}{3}\\quad\\mathrm{changing\\:sign\\:and\\:inverting\\:the\\:last\\:fraction}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{7p}{3}\\times\\frac{2}{3}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\;by\\:4}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{14p}{9}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{m^{2}}{n}\\div6m\\). 8 Don\u2019t forget that \\(6m=\\frac{6m}{1}\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{m^{2}}{n}\\div6m &amp; =\\frac{m^{2}}{n}\\div\\frac{6m}{1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{m^{2}}{n}\\times\\frac{1}{6m}\\quad\\mathrm{changing\\:sign\\:and\\:inverting\\:the\\:last\\:fraction}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{m}{n}\\times\\frac{1}{6}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\;by\\:\\mathit{m}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{m}{6n}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{4\\left(x+3\\right)}{9}\\div\\frac{24}{5x}.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{4\\left(x+3\\right)}{9}\\div\\frac{24}{5x} &amp; =\\frac{4\\left(x+3\\right)}{9}\\times\\frac{5x}{24}\\quad\\mathrm{changing\\:sign\\:and\\:inverting\\:the\\:last\\:fraction}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{\\left(x+3\\right)}{9}\\times\\frac{5x}{6}\\quad\\mathrm{dividing\\:top\\:and\\:bottom\\;by\\:4}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{5x\\left(x+3\\right)}{54}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tSimplify \\(\\frac{2a+4}{15}\\div\\frac{a+2}{6}.\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2a+4}{15}\\div\\frac{a+2}{6} &amp; =\\frac{2a+4}{15}\\times\\frac{6}{a+2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2\\left(a+2\\right)}{15}\\times\\frac{6}{a+2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2}{15}\\times\\frac{6}{1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2}{5}\\times\\frac{2}{1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{4}{5}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nExercise 1\r\nSimplify the following fractions:\r\n\r\n \t\\(\\frac{12ab^{2}}{8bc}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{5x-20}{5}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{9u-18}{2u-4}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{6t-9}{12-8t}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{b}{b^{2}+7b}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{\\left(j+4\\right)\\left(j-4\\right)}{3j+12}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{2\\left(5-v\\right)}{3v-15}\\)\r\n \t\\(\\frac{9r^{2}-3r}{16r-48r^{2}}\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise 2\r\nA.

This is a short movie on multiplying and dividing algebraic fractions. Let\u2019s start by looking at a normal fraction, 18 over 24. Notice that 18 and 24 are divisible by six, six into 18 goes three, sixes into 24 goes four, in other words the answer is three over four. See that six is a common factor of 18 and 24. Similarly 120 over 70 has a common factor of 10 because 10 will divide into both 120 and 70 leaving us with an answer of 12 over seven.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an algebraic fraction. Notice how I\u2019ve ... N minus N squared becomes N minus N minus N and in doing so the factor N minus N will cancel both top and bottom. Four eight squared Y over six Y squared, notice here how I\u2019ve expanded the X squared and the Y squared to look for factors, here there\u2019s a factor of Y top and bottom and there\u2019s a factor of two that divides both into four and six. And finally six X plus nine Y in the denominator will actually factorise into three brackets two X plus Y three Y and in doing so the threes now become factors top and bottom.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s multiply algebraic fractions. Here\u2019s a simple fraction where I\u2019ve looked for factors both top and bottom, once that\u2019s done you can cancel the factors in the numerator with factors in the denominator, as done with the previous slide. Similarly with an algebraic fraction the As will cancel because they are common factors, there\u2019s also a factor of seven.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a more complicated algebraic fraction, but notice the method is still the same, X minus two is a factor, X is a factor and likewise with the second example, I\u2019ve taken a factor of three out of three M plus 12 giving me three brackets M plus four, the M squared plus four M will factorise into M brackets M plus four, again notice in doing this I can now factorise the top and the bottom factors M plus four.\r\n\r\nDividing algebraic fractions is very much the same but remember the rule, when you divide by a fraction you change the division sign to a multiplication sign and then you invert the fraction that comes afterwards. Here I\u2019ve done this and I\u2019ve factored the eight and 12. Always cancel where possible.\r\n\r\nThe second example I\u2019ve done exactly the same, the factor of four is on the top and 24 on the bottom, fours into four, fours into 24 and finally here\u2019s another example where I\u2019ve taken a factor of two outside of two A plus four allowing me to factorise the top and bottom of the fraction, the factor here being the A plus two.\r\n\r\nNow try some problems for yourself. The answers to these questions are on the next slide. Thanks for watching this short movie.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"What is an algebraic fraction? The numerator (top) or denominator (bottom) of a fraction can be in algebraic form involving numbers and variables (represented by pronumerals or letters). We cover the multiplication and division of fractions containing algebraic terms. Simplifying fractions You have probably seen numerical fractions like \\(\\frac{18}{24}\\) before. Generally we like to reduce fractions to their simplest form. This is done by dividing the numerator and denominator by the same number.1 The numerator is the number on top and the denominator is the number at the bottom of the fraction. So \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} \\frac{18}{24} &amp; =\\frac{9}{12}\\quad\\mathrm{\\mathrm{dividing}\\ top\\ and\\ bottom\\ [&hellip;]","date":"16 October 2023","link":"\/maths-statistics\/algebra\/a15-algebraic-fractions-multiplication-and-division\/","keywords":["Algebra","Arithmetic","Functions","Maths equations"]},{"id":2968,"title":"A2.2 Rearranging formulas &ndash; Brackets and fractions","content":"\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn how to manipulate or rearrange formulas that involve fractions and brackets.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nFormulas are used in many branches of economics, science and engineering. For example, the formula for simple interest is:1 Note that when we write \\(nr\\) we mean \\(n\\times r\\). Most of the time we ignore the multiplication sign \u201c\\(\\times\\)\u201d as it can be confused with \\(x\\). Also when we write \\(A=P(1+nr)\\) the \\(P\\) outside the bracket is multiplying everything in the bracket. That is we mean \\(A=P\\times\\left(1+nr\\right)\\). For the same reason we do not write the multiply sign. \\[ A=P(1+nr) \\] Here, \\(A\\) is the amount you have after \\(n\\) time periods (months or years usually), \\(P\\) is the amount you invest, and \\(r\\) is the interest rate per time period. \\(A\\) is called the of the formula because the formula is in the form \\(A\\) is equal to \u2026 .\r\n\r\nWhat about if we want \\(P\\) to be the subject? As a first step we could get rid of the \\(\\left(1+nr\\right)\\) term that is multiplying \\(P\\). The opposite of multiplication is division. To get rid of the \\(\\left(1+nr\\right)\\) we divide both sides of the formula by \\(\\left(1+nr\\right)\\).2 When rearranging formulas, the main rule is: whatever you do to one side you must do to the other.\r\n\r\nWhat we get is:\r\n\r\n\\[ \\frac{A}{(1+nr)}=\\frac{P(1+nr)}{(1+nr)} \\] Now the \\((1+nr)\\) terms can be canceled to get: \\[ \\frac{A}{(1+nr)}=P \\] or \\[ P=\\frac{A}{(1+nr)} \\]\r\n\r\nWhen rearranging formulas, the starting point depends on the formula itself. We illustrate this in the examples below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tSuppose you have $1000 to invest and you want to know how long it will take to get $2000 with an interest rate of 5% per year with simple interest.\r\nThe formula for simple interest is \\[ A=P(1+rn) \\] and we know A=$2000, \\(P=\\$1000\\) and \\(r=5%=5\/100=0.05\\). We want to find \\(n\\).\r\nSolution:\r\nOur first step is to get rid of the \\(P\\) that is multiplying the bracket \\((1+rn)\\). We do this by dividing both sides by \\(P\\) to get \\[ \\frac{A}{P}=\\frac{P(1+rn)}{P}. \\] Now we cancel the \\(P\\) to get 3 There is actually a 1 multiplying the bracket we never show it. Because multiplying by 1 does not change anything, we can remove the brackets as shown below. \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{A}{P} &amp; =\\left(1+rn\\right)\\\\ &amp; =1+rn. \\end{align*}\\] Next we want to get the \\(rn\\) on its own. We do this by subtracting 1 from both sides to get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{A}{P}-1 &amp; =1+rn-1\\\\ &amp; =rn. \\end{align*}\\] The last step is to get \\(n\\) on its own. We do this by dividing both sides by \\(r\\)4 Remember dividing by \\(r\\) is the same as multiplying by \\(1\/r\\).\r\n\\[ \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{A}{P}-1\\right)=\\frac{nr}{r}. \\] Canceling the \\(r\\) on the right hand side gives: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{A}{P}-1\\right) &amp; =n\\\\ n &amp; =\\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{A}{P}-1\\right). \\end{align*}\\] We can now calculate \\(n\\) by substituting the values for \\(A\\), \\(P\\) and \\(r\\): \\[\\begin{align*} n &amp; =\\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{A}{P}-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{0.05}\\left(\\frac{2000}{1000}-1\\right)\\\\ &amp; =20. \\end{align*}\\] So it will take 20 years to double the initial $1000 investment!\r\n \tTransform the formula \\(P=2(L-W)\\) to make \u2018\\(L\\)\u2019 the subject.\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} P &amp; =2\\left(L-W\\right)\\\\ \\frac{P}{2} &amp; =\\frac{2\\left(L-W\\right)}{2}\\quad\\left(\\textrm{divide both sides by 2}\\right)\\\\ \\frac{P}{2} &amp; =L-W\\quad\\left(\\textrm{cancel the 2 and remove the brackets}\\right)\\\\ \\frac{P}{2}+W &amp; =L-W+W\\quad\\left(\\textrm{add $W$ to both sides}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =L\\\\ L &amp; =\\frac{P}{2}+W\\quad\\textrm{rearrange to put $L$ on the left}. \\end{align*}\\] Note that you don\u2019t have to put explanations on each line in your solution. We include the notes to show you what we are doing.\r\n \tTransform the formula \\(P=2(L-W)\\) to make \\(W\\) the subject.\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} P &amp; =2\\left(L-W\\right)\\\\ \\frac{P}{2} &amp; =\\frac{2\\left(L-W\\right)}{2}\\quad\\left(\\textrm{divide both sides by 2}\\right)\\\\ \\frac{P}{2} &amp; =L-W\\quad\\left(\\textrm{cancel the 2 and remove the brackets}\\right)\\\\ \\frac{P}{2}-L &amp; =L-W-L\\quad\\left(\\textrm{subtract $L$ from both sides}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =-W\\\\ -W &amp; =\\frac{P}{2}-L\\quad\\textrm{$\\left(\\textrm{rearrange to put$-W$ on the left}\\right)$ }\\\\ W &amp; =-\\frac{P}{2}+L\\quad\\textrm{$\\left(\\textrm{multiply both sides by $-1$ to get +$W$ on left}\\right)$ }\\\\ &amp; =L-\\frac{P}{2}\\quad\\textrm{$\\left(\\textrm{rearrange terms (optional)}\\right)$ .} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tRearrange the formula \\(L=\\left(Mt-g\\right)\/b\\) to make \u2018M\u2019 the subject.5 In this case the fraction bar on the right hand side acts like a bracket. That is the \\(b\\) on the bottom is dividing into the \\(Mt\\) and \\(-g\\) terms.\r\nSolution: \\[\\begin{align*} L &amp; =\\frac{Mt-g}{b}\\\\ Lb &amp; =Mt-g\\quad\\textrm{$\\left(\\textrm{multiplying both sides by $b$ and cancelling $b$ on right}\\right)$ }\\\\ Lb+g &amp; =Mt-g+g\\quad\\left(\\textrm{adding $g$ to both sides}\\right)\\\\ &amp; =Mt\\\\ \\frac{Lb+g}{t} &amp; =M\\quad\\textrm{$\\left(\\textrm{dividing both sides by $t$ }\\right)$ }\\\\ M &amp; =\\frac{Lb+g}{t}\\quad\\textrm{$\\left(\\textrm{rewrite to put M on left}\\right)$ .} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake \\(v\\) the subject of \\(E=mgh+\\) \\(\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}.\\)\r\nSolution:6 This example is a bit briefer and closer to what you should aim for because we are not showing things like \\(mgh-mgh\\) (which are equal to zero) on the third line of the solution. We also use a square root function (the opposite to squaring) to get \\(v\\) from \\(v^{2}\\) in the last line. Note that taking the square root of a positive number gives two possibilities - one positive, the other negative. Usually a formula will relate to a physical situation and the negative solution may not make sense. In this case, you take the positive solution as the answer. We do this in the last step of the solution. \\[\\begin{align*} E &amp; =mgh+\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\\\\ E-mgh &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\\quad\\left(\\textrm{subtracting $mgh$ from both sides}\\right)\\\\ 2\\left(E-mgh\\right) &amp; =mv^{2}\\quad\\left(\\textrm{multiplying both sides by $2$ }\\right)\\\\ \\frac{2\\left(E-mgh\\right)}{m} &amp; =v^{2}\\quad\\textrm{$\\left(\\textrm{dividing both sides by $m$ }\\right)$ }\\\\ v^{2} &amp; =\\frac{2\\left(E-mgh\\right)}{m}\\\\ v &amp; =\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\left(E-mgh\\right)}{m}}\\quad\\textrm{$\\left(\\textrm{taking the square root of both sides}\\right)$ }\\\\ &amp; =\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\left(E-mgh\\right)}{m}}\\quad\\textrm{$\\left(\\textrm{taking the positive root as the answer.}\\right)$ } \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tIf \\(2\/k=(j+1)\/3,\\) find \\(k\\).\r\nSolution: Note that the fraction bar acts like a bracket. When we multiply both sides by \\(k\\) the \\(j+1\\) term is put into a bracket \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{2}{k} &amp; =\\frac{j+1}{3}\\\\ 2 &amp; =\\frac{k\\left(j+1\\right)}{3}\\quad\\textrm{$\\left(\\textrm{multiplying both sides by $k$ }\\right)$ }\\\\ 6 &amp; =k\\left(j+1\\right)\\quad\\left(\\textrm{multiplying both sides by $3$ }\\right)\\\\ \\frac{6}{j+1} &amp; =k\\quad\\left(\\textrm{dividing both sides by $j+1$ }\\right)\\\\ k &amp; =\\frac{6}{j+1}. \\end{align*}\\] It is possible to do the first two steps in one action as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} 6 &amp; =k\\left(j+1\\right). \\end{align*}\\] This is called cross-multiplication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise\r\n\r\n \t\\(S=C(A+B)\\text{, find $A$ .}\\)\r\n \t\\(V=\\frac{Ah}{3},\\text{find }A.\\)\r\n \t\\(A=\\frac{h\\left(a+b\\right)}{2}\\), find \\(a.\\)\r\n \t\\(A=\\frac{2B+C}{P},\\text{ find }B.\\)\r\n \t\\(A=\\frac{2P\\left(B-C\\right)}{3},\\) find \\(C\\).\r\n \t\\(I=\\frac{Mr^{2}}{2},\\) find \\(r.\\)\r\n \t\\(H=k\\left(1-bt\\right)\\), find \\(b\\).\r\n \t\\(t=2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{h+k}{g}}\\), find \\(h.\\)\r\n \t\\(v^{2}=u^{2}+2as\\), find \\(u.\\)\r\n \t\\(m=\\sqrt{\\frac{x+y}{z}}\\), find \\(y.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload this page, A2.2 Rearranging formulas: Brackets and fractions (PDF 212KB) \r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Learn how to manipulate or rearrange formulas that involve fractions and brackets.

We want to rearrange to get \\(m=\\cdots\\). \\[ E=mgh+\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}. \\] In this case the \\(m\\) \u2019s are already on the same side of the equation so we can take out \\(m\\) as a factor: \\[ E=m\\left(gh+\\frac{1}{2}v^{2}\\right). \\] To get \\(m\\) on its own we divide both sides by \\(gh+\\frac{1}{2}v^{2}\\) to get: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{E}{gh+\\frac{1}{2}v^{2}} &amp; =\\frac{m\\left(gh+\\frac{1}{2}v^{2}\\right)}{gh+\\frac{1}{2}v^{2}}\\\\ &amp; =m\\quad\\left(\\textrm{after cancelling}\\right). \\end{align*}\\] That is, \\[ m=\\frac{E}{gh+\\frac{1}{2}v^{2}}. \\] It is possible to improve the look of the answer by getting rid of the \\(1\/2\\) in the denominator. We do this by multiplying the top and bottom of the right hand side by \\(2\\) to get: \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{E}{gh+\\frac{1}{2}v^{2}}\\times\\frac{2}{2}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{2E}{2gh+v^{2}}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake \\(I\\) the subject of the formula \\(Ir=E-IR\\).\r\nFirst get all terms involving \\(I\\) to one side by adding \\(IR\\) to both sides: \\[\\begin{align*} Ir+IR &amp; =E-IR+IR\\\\ &amp; =E. \\end{align*}\\] Take \\(I\\) out as common factor: \\[\\begin{align*} I\\left(r+R\\right) &amp; =E.\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] Now divide both sides by \\(r+R\\): \\[ I=\\frac{E}{r+R}. \\]\r\n\r\nThe examples above showed all steps in detail.

You then proceed as usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tFor example, make \\(u\\) the subject of the formula \\(1\/f=1\/v-1\/u\\). A suitable common divisor of the denominators is \\(fvu\\).3 A common divisor is the product of the denominators. For example to simplify \\(\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{8}\\) you can use a lowest common denominator of \\(8\\) or a common denominator of \\(8\\times4=32\\). Either will give the same result, though the lowest common denominator involves smaller numbers. To simplify algebraic fractions like \\(\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{1}{u}\\) we must use a common denominator \\(v\\times u=vu\\) as we don\u2019t know the values of \\(v\\) and \\(u\\).  Multiplying both sides of the formula by \\(fvu\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{f}fvu &amp; =\\frac{1}{v}fvu-\\frac{1}{u}fvu\\\\ vu &amp; =fu-fv\\quad\\left(\\textrm{after canceling the terms}\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Next step is to get all terms involving \\(u\\) on the same side: \\[\\begin{align*} vu-fu &amp; =-fv\\quad\\left(\\textrm{subtracting $fu$ from both sides}\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Now we factorize the left hand side: \\[\\begin{align*} u\\left(v-f\\right) &amp; =-fv. \\end{align*}\\] The final step is to divide both sides by \\(v-f\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} u &amp; =\\frac{-fv}{v-f}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{fv}{v-f}. \\end{align*}\\] This is a correct answer but having a \\(-\\) sign in front is ugly. We get rid of it by multiplying the top and bottom of the right hand side by \\(-1\\): \\[\\begin{align*} u &amp; =\\frac{-fv\\left(-1\\right)}{\\left(v-f\\right)\\left(-1\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{fv}{\\left(f-v\\right)}. \\end{align*}\\] The example above showed all steps. You don\u2019t have to provide such detail.

Consider the figure below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \\(x\\) \u2013 coordinate is always given first.\r\n\r\nThe point A (\\(2,3\\)) has coordinates \\(x=2\\) and \\(y=3\\).\r\n\r\nThe point B (\\(1,3\\)) has coordinates \\(x=1\\) and \\(y=3\\).\r\n\r\nThe point C (\\(3,3\\)) has coordinates \\(x=3\\) and \\(y=3\\).\r\n\r\nThe point D (\\(3,4\\)) has coordinates \\(x=3\\) and \\(y=4\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSketch graphs\r\nWhen sketching a graph it is not necessary to plot large numbers of points. Only the basic shape of the graph is required, although some important points need to be clearly labeled.\r\n\r\nIntercepts\r\nThese are the points where the graph crosses the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes. The \\(x\\)-intercept is where the graph cuts the \\(x\\)-axis \\(\\left(y=0\\right)\\) and the \\(y\\)-intercept is where the graph cuts the \\(y\\)-axis \\(\\left(x=0\\right)\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLinear graphs\r\nThe graph of a linear relationship is a straight line. Only two points are needed to sketch the graph of a straight line.\r\n\r\nExample\r\nSketch the function \\(y=3x+6\\).\r\nSolution:\r\nDetermine two points on the line.\r\nThe \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)-intercepts are often the easiest to find.\r\nFor the \\(y\\)- intercept \\(\\left(x=0\\right)\\), we have \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =3x+6\\\\ &amp; =6. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the \\(y\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,6\\right)\\).\r\nNow we want the \\(x\\)- intercept \\(\\left(y=0\\right).\\) So \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =3x+6\\\\ 0 &amp; =3x+6\\\\ 3x &amp; =-6\\\\ x &amp; =-2. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nHence the \\(x\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(-2,0\\right).\\)\r\nThe y-intercept is the point \\((0,6\\)).\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} x\\textrm{-intercept} &amp; (y=0)\\\\ \\textrm{When }y &amp; =0\\\\ 0 &amp; =3x+6\\\\ 3x &amp; =-6\\\\ x &amp; =-2 \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe x-intercept is the point ( 2, 0).\r\n\r\nConnect the two points with a straight line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-intercepts should be marked on the graph.\r\nSee Exercise 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGradient\r\nThe slope of the straight line is called the gradient. This is the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run) between two points (\\(x_{1},y_{1}\\)) and (\\(x_{2},y_{2}\\)) on the line.\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} Gradient &amp; =\\frac{rise}{run}=\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tFind the gradient of the line \\(y=3x+6\\) (see previous example).\r\nSolution:\r\nThe points (\\(0,6\\)) and (\\(-2,0\\)) are on the line \\(y=3x+6\\).1 Note that it doesn\u2019t matter which points you choose for \\(\\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right)\\). The only requirement is that both points must be on the line. For example we could let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(-2,0\\right) \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(0,6\\right) \\end{align*}\\] then \\[\\begin{align*} Gradient &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{6-0}{0-\\left(-2\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =3 \\end{align*}\\] the same answer as at left. Let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(0,6\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(-2,0\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Then \\[\\begin{align*} Gradient &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}=\\frac{0-6}{-2-0}=\\frac{-6}{-2}=3. \\end{align*}\\] The gradient is 3.\r\n \tFind the gradient of the line joining the two points \\(\\left(1,3\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(4,5\\right).\\)\r\nSolution:\r\nLet \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(1,3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(4,5\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Then \\[\\begin{align*} Gradient &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}=\\frac{5-3}{4-1}=\\frac{2}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] The gradient is \\(2\/3.\\)\r\n\r\nSee Exercise 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEquation of a straight line\r\nThe general equation of a straight line is \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =mx+c \\end{align*}\\] where \\(m\\) is the gradient, and \\(c\\) is the value of the intercept on the \\(y\\)-axis. The figure below illustrates this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe equation of a straight line can also be written as2 To see this, assume you know a point \\(\\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right)\\) on the line and the gradient \\(m\\) of the line. Since \\(\\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right)\\) is on the line, it must satisfy the equation \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =mx+c. &amp; \\left(1\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and so \\[\\begin{align*} y_{1} &amp; =mx_{1}+c. &amp; \\left(2\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Now subtract \\(\\left(2\\right)\\) from \\(\\left(1\\right)\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} y-y_{1} &amp; =mx+c-\\left(mx_{1}+c\\right)\\\\ &amp; =mx-mx_{1}+c-c\\\\ &amp; =m\\left(x-x_{1}\\right). \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*} y-y_{1} &amp; =m(x-x_{1}) \\end{align*}\\] where \\(m\\) is the gradient and (\\(x_{1},y_{1}\\)) is a point on the line. This is called point-slope form because it assumes you know\r\n\r\n \tA point on the line \\(\\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right)\\) and\r\n \tThe gradient \\(m\\) of the line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome properties of linear graphs\r\n\r\n \tA line that slopes up and to the right has a positive gradient.\r\n \tA line that slopes up and to the left has a negative gradient.\r\n \tParallel lines have the same gradient.\r\n \tThe gradients of two mutually perpendicular lines multiply to \\(-1.\\)\r\n \tA line parallel to the x \u2013 axis has a gradient of \\(0\\).\r\n \tA line parallel to the y \u2013 axis; the gradient is undefined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1: Find the gradient and the equation of the straight line\r\n\r\nSolution\r\nFirst note that the graph has a positive gradient.3 Because it slopes up (increases) as you move to the right. You don\u2019t have to write this but it is a good check to have in mind. If you calculate a negative gradient, you know something has gone wrong. Let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(1,3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(3,7\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Then the gradient \\(m\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{7-3}{3-1}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{4}{2}\\\\ &amp; =2. \\end{align*}\\] So the gradient \\(m=2.\\) From the graph we see the \\(y\\)-intercept is \\(1.\\) That is, \\(c=1.\\) Now we can substitute in the equation for a line4 The equation for a line is \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =mx+c. \\end{align*}\\] to get \\[\\begin{align*} y &amp; =2x+1. \\end{align*}\\] The equation for the line is \\(y=2x+1.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 2: Find the gradient and the equation of the straight line\r\n\r\nSolution\r\nFirst note that the graph has a negative gradient.5 Because it slopes down (decreases) as you move to the right. You don\u2019t have to write this but it is a good check to have in mind. If you calculate a positive gradient, you know something has gone wrong.\r\n\r\nLet \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(0,4\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(6,0\\right) \\end{align*}\\] Then the gradient \\(m\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{0-4}{6-0}\\\\ &amp; =-\\frac{2}{3}. \\end{align*}\\] The \\(y\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,4\\right)\\) and so \\(c=4.\\) Hence the equation of the line is \\(y=-\\frac{2}{3}x+4.\\) This is a correct answer but the fraction makes it look a bit ugly. We can multiply both sides by \\(3\\) to get rid of the fraction. The equation then becomes: \\(3y=-2x+12\\) or \\(3y+2x=12.\\)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3: Sketch the function \\(2y=x-6\\) and state the gradient of the straight line\r\nSolution\r\nFirst find the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) intercepts. For the \\(x\\)-intercept, set \\(y=0\\) then \\[\\begin{align*} 0 &amp; =x-6\\\\ \\text{and }x &amp; =6. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the \\(x\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(6,0\\right)\\).\r\n\r\nFor the \\(y\\)-intercept, set \\(x=0\\) then \\[\\begin{align*} 2y &amp; =-6\\\\ \\text{and }y &amp; =-3. \\end{align*}\\] Hence the \\(y\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,-3\\right).\\)\r\n\r\nNow draw a line between these two points as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find the gradient, let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(0,-3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(6,0\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Then the gradient \\(m\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\\\ &amp; \\frac{0-\\left(-3\\right)}{6-0}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{3}{6}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}. \\end{align*}\\] Alternatively, to find the gradient divide both sides of the equation by \\(2\\) to get \\[\\begin{align*} 2y &amp; =x-6\\\\ y &amp; =\\frac{1}{2}x-3. \\end{align*}\\] This is in the standard form \\(y=mx+c\\) and we see that the gradient \\(m=1\/2\\) as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 4: Sketch the graph of \\(3y+2x=0\\) and state the gradient of the straight line\r\nSolution\r\nFirst find the intercepts. For the \\(x\\)-intercept \\(y=0\\). Substituting in the equation we get \\[\\begin{align*} 2x &amp; =0\\\\ x &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] and the \\(x\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,0\\right).\\) For the \\(y\\)-intercept, \\(x=0.\\) Substituting in the equation we get \\[\\begin{align*} 3y &amp; =0\\\\ y &amp; =0 \\end{align*}\\] and the \\(y\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,0\\right).\\) But this means the \\(x\\)-intercept is equal to the \\(y\\)-intercept. This is because the line passes through the origin \\(\\left(0,0\\right)\\).6 We could have seen this by considering the equation of the line: \\(3y+2x=0.\\) Rearranging the equation and dividing by \\(3\\) we get \\[\\begin{align*} 3y+2x &amp; =0\\\\ 3y &amp; =-2x\\\\ y &amp; =-\\frac{2}{3}x. \\end{align*}\\] Comparing this to the standard form \\(y=mx+c\\) we see that \\(m=-2\/3\\) and \\(c=0.\\) That is the \\(y\\)-intercept is at \\(\\left(0,0\\right).\\)\r\n\r\nSo far we know the graph goes through \\(\\left(0,0\\right).\\) To sketch its graph we need another point. To find another point on the line, pick any value of \\(x\\) (other than \\(0\\)). Let\u2019s take \\(x=3\\) then substituting into the equation we have \\[\\begin{align*} 3y+2\\left(3\\right) &amp; =0\\\\ 3y &amp; =-6\\\\ y &amp; =-2 \\end{align*}\\] so the point \\(\\left(3,-2\\right)\\) is on the graph.\r\n\r\nTo sketch the graph, we plot the points \\(\\left(0,0\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(3,-2\\right)\\) and draw a line through them as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find the gradient, rearrange the equation to the form of \\(y=mx+c\\):\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{align*} 3y+2x &amp; =0\\\\ y &amp; =-\\frac{2}{3}x \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe gradient of the line is \\(-\\frac{2}{3}\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 5: Find the equation of the line that passes through the points \\(\\left(-1,3\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(2,0\\right)\\)\r\nSolution\r\nFirst find the gradient \\(m.\\) Let \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{1},y_{1}\\right) &amp; =\\left(-1,3\\right) \\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*} \\left(x_{2},y_{2}\\right) &amp; =\\left(2,0\\right). \\end{align*}\\] Then the gradient \\(m\\) is given by \\[\\begin{align*} m &amp; =\\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\\\ &amp; \\frac{0-3}{2-\\left(-1\\right)}\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{-3}{3}\\\\ &amp; =-1. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\nThe equation to our line is \\(y=-x+c\\).

Let's work on some essential skills in manipulating formulas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nSome of the most important equations that we might be required to transpose occur frequently in science, engineering and economics. They are called formulae and give a general rule describing the relationship between variable quantities\r\n\r\nHere are some examples: \\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} A= &amp; \\pi r^{2} \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} s &amp; =ut+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2} \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\n\\[\\begin{alignat*}{1} S= &amp; P(1+i)^{n} \\end{alignat*}\\]\r\n\r\nIn these examples \\(A\\), \\(s\\) and \\(S\\) are, respectively, the subjects of the formulae.1 \\(A\\), \\(s\\) and \\(S\\) are called subjects because they are on the left hand side of the formula and followed by an equal sign. Sometimes a formula is given in a particular form and it is necessary to rearrange the formula to make a different variable the subject:\r\n\r\nWe know the area of a circle \\(A=\\pi r^{2}\\) where \\(r\\) is the radius and so we can calculate \\(A\\) for any value of \\(r\\). What if we know the area \\(A\\) and have to calculate the radius \\(r\\)?2 We need \\(r\\) to be the subject rather than \\(A\\).\r\n\r\nWe know \\(s=ut+\\frac{1}{2}at^{2}\\) but what if we know \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) and want to calculate \\(a\\)?3 We need \\(a\\) to be the subject rather than \\(s\\).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic Rule\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen rearranging equations and formulas, whatever you do on one side of the equal sign, you must do on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\n \tMake \\(A\\) the subject in the formula \\(A+B=C\\).\r\nSolution:4 We have to get rid of the \\(B\\) term on the left hand side to get \\(A\\) on its own. The \\(B\\) is being added to \\(A\\) on the left side so we subtract \\(B\\) from the left side to get rid of the \\(B\\) terms on the left. Our rule says we must subtract the \\(B\\) from the right side as well. \\[\\begin{align*} A+B &amp; =C\\\\ A+B-B &amp; =C-B\\quad\\textrm{subtracting $B$ from both sides}\\\\ A &amp; =C-B. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake \\(A\\) the subject in the formula \\(A-B=C\\).\r\nSolution:5 We have to get rid of the \\(B\\) term on the left hand side to get \\(A\\) on its own. The \\(B\\) is being subtracted from \\(A\\) on the left side so we add \\(B\\) to the left side to get rid of it. Our rule says we must add B to the right side as well. \\[\\begin{align*} A-B &amp; =C\\\\ A-B+B &amp; =C+B\\quad\\textrm{adding $B$ to both sides}\\\\ A &amp; =C+B. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake \\(A\\) the subject in the formula \\(AB=C\\).\r\nSolution:6 We have to get rid of the \\(B\\) term on the left hand side to get \\(A\\) on its own. The \\(B\\) is multiplying \\(A\\) on the left side so we divide by \\(B\\) on the left side to get rid of it. Our rule says we must divide by B on the right side as well. \\[\\begin{align*} AB &amp; =C\\\\ \\frac{AB}{B} &amp; =\\frac{C}{B}\\quad\\textrm{dividing both sides by $B$ }\\\\ A &amp; =\\frac{C}{B}\\quad\\textrm{cancelling the $B$ 's on the left side.} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake \\(A\\) the subject in the formula \\(\\frac{A}{B}=C\\).\r\nSolution:7 We have to get rid of the \\(B\\) term on the left hand side to get \\(A\\) on its own. The \\(B\\) is dividing \\(A\\) on the left side so we multiply by \\(B\\) on the left side to get rid of it. Our rule says we must multiply by B on the right side as well. \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{A}{B} &amp; =C\\\\ \\frac{AB}{B} &amp; =BC\\quad\\textrm{multiplying both sides by $B$ }\\\\ A &amp; =BC\\quad\\textrm{cancelling the $B$ 's on the left side.} \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake \\(A\\) the subject of the formula \\(A^{2}=B\\).\r\nSolution:8 This case involves \\(A^{2}\\). The inverse (opposite) operation to squaring is the square root. So to get A on its own we need to take the square root of both sides.  \\[\\begin{align*} A^{2} &amp; =B\\\\ \\sqrt{A^{2}} &amp; =\\sqrt{B}\\quad\\textrm{taking the square root of both sides}\\\\ A &amp; =\\sqrt{B}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n \tMake A the subject of the formula \\(\\sqrt{A}=B\\).\r\nSolution:9 This case involves \\(\\sqrt{A}\\). The inverse (opposite) operation to the square root is squaring. So to get A on its own we need to square both sides. \\[\\begin{align*} \\sqrt{A} &amp; =B\\\\ \\left(\\sqrt{A}\\right)^{2} &amp; =B^{2}\\\\ A &amp; =B^{2}. \\end{align*}\\]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInverse operations\r\nIn the above examples we used operations to \"undo\" operations.

In APA 7th edition, for example, your citation will need to include the author(s)' surname(s) and the year of publication for paraphrases, and for direct quotes, you will also need to include the page number where you found the original text.\r\n\"Ecosystems are the silent architects of our world, weaving the web of life that sustains us all.\" (Kumar, 2024, p. 299)\r\nOrally: by mentioning the author(s) of the original material outloud. \r\n\r\nFor more information, visit Understanding citation.\r\nReferences list\r\nFor your presentation, you should include a slide with a refence list. This list should be formatted in the same way that you would format a reference list for a written assignment.\r\n\r\nReferencing images\r\nReferencing images can be confusing at times. Luckily, RMIT has developed a great referencing resource called Easy Cite that guides students through the referencing process. It has rules and examples for referencing and citing in all of the major referencing styles used at RMIT, and the sections for each of these styles has information for referencing images and audiovisual material. \r\n\r\nTips for managing references\r\n\r\nAs you research, note down the publication details of books, article, videos, etc. This will save you from having to search for it later, which can be very difficult.\r\nCite as you write- put citations into your writing from the beginning. This will help you avoid confusion about which information belongs to which author.\r\nIf you have doubts about how to reference a resource, contact Study Support.

This helps you think critically, which is one of the key skills required in university study.\r\nIn this section, we will start by learning about the key steps and elements of argument analysis before providing you with an example to test your new knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe steps of argument analysis\r\nHere are the key steps to help you break down and assess an argument effectively.\r\nStep one: What is the argument?\r\nAn argument is the position or claim that the writer is putting forward. \u00a0An argument can be recognised via:\r\n\r\nlanguage\r\nevidence \r\ntext comparisons.\r\nAn argument will assume an audience's awareness of the topic and also consider their assumptions, prior knowledge and interest.\r\n\r\nSee also Reading skills.\r\nStep two: Identifying bias\r\nBias can be recognised via language, sentence structure, evidence used for supporting claims (including quality of evidence), lack of evidence for refuting claims, repetition of themes and language.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to examine your own biases. When all you can think about is your own perspective on an argument, you blind yourself to the actual argument before you. Therefore, it can be useful to identify your own feelings on the topics and be aware of them. Also, remember to keep an open mind while you read.\r\nStep three: Who is the audience? Who is the writer?\r\nThe audience is the assumed readership that the author wants to persuade or influence. Think about who the writer is writing for, and why they are writing to that audience. Is their intention to persuade, inform or entertain them? \r\n\r\nSome texts provide useful information about the author, such as their level of expertise, profession, or affiliations. If this information is not provided then a search for their name can often turn up the results you need. Knowing the writer's profession or affiliations can help us understand their motives, and knowing their level of expertise can inform us about whether or not we should take their view seriously.\r\nStep four: How does the author influence the audience?\r\nSelected vocabulary (which could include colloquial or slang words), language techniques and sentence construction are used to appeal to a particular audience. Arguments are carefully considered to ensure they are convincing to the target audience.\r\nStep five: Critically analyse by identifying claims, evidence and assumptions\r\nCritical analysis starts with these questions:\r\n\r\n \tWhat is the overall claim of the author?\r\n \tIs the claim backed up by credible evidence?\r\n \tIs the claim based on assumptions?\r\n\r\nStep six: What is the evidence?\r\nEvidence includes information or data from elsewhere to support the claims the writer makes, or refute the claims made by others. Evidence can be judged for quality by the credibility of its origin. Evidence needs to come from a source that has authority and is up-to-date and objective.\r\nIs the evidence credible?\r\nCredible evidence comes from a source that the reader can believe is factual and valid. The key things to look for are:\r\n\r\n \tAuthor: Who does the author work for or write for? What other publications have they been involved in? What is their area and level of expertise in the topic\r\n \tDate: Is the information current given the topic?\r\n \tSource: Is the publication source well known or respected in the industry?

The web can be a good starting place.\r\n\r\nWhen you search for information on a topic, the list of results may include Wikipedia or social media sites such as YouTube, blogs, Twitter, and Facebook. \r\n\r\nCan you use information from Wikipedia or social media websites for academic study? Take the quiz to find out.\r\nActivity: The web and academic study\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle and other search engines\r\nThe web is a rich source of information. Students usually use search engines like Google to find information about an assignment topic, but finding useful resources among many pages of search results can be challenging.\r\n\r\nGoogle and other search engines are easy to search, but they produce a large number of results and many that are not relevant to the topic.\r\n\r\nFortunately, you can conduct a much more efficient search and save yourself lots of time and effort by using a few simple search commands. Try  Lifehack's 20 Tips to use Google Search efficiently.\r\n\r\nGoogle is a good place to find background or general information, but you need to be aware of its limitations for academic research.\r\nWhy can't I just Google it?\r\nThis question is covered in more detail in the next tutorial.\r\nUsing Wikipedia for academic research\r\nWhen you do a Google search about a topic you will most likely find Wikipedia listings at the top of your search results. However, Wikipedia is not considered a reliable source of information. This is because we do not know who has added information, what their expertise on the subject is or if the information they have added is accurate.\r\n\r\nWikipedia can be a great place to start your search as it can give you a general understanding of a topic and you can use the sources listed at the bottom of the page as part of your search. However, it is not recommended that you cite Wikipedia articles in your assignments.\r\nGoogle Scholar\r\nAnother way to search the web more effectively is to use Google Scholar as your search engine. Google Scholar is a simple way to search for scholarly literature in articles, theses, books, abstracts and other formats.\r\n\r\nIf you access Google Scholar from the RMIT Library website using your RMIT login, your search results will link you back to the full text resources held by the Library. Go to the Library Google Scholar page for more information.\r\nFor more help on using Google Scholar for research go to Google Scholar search tips or find a video on YouTube.","excerpt":"This section will cover the 'where' and the 'how' of finding information for your research.

These databases can include journal articles, news articles, ebooks, streaming videos, and specialised information such as standards, theses, case studies and images.\r\n\r\nSo what is a library database?\r\n\r\n\r\nChoosing a database\r\nDatabases are a rich source of information in the subject areas taught at RMIT University, but there are many different databases. How do you know which one to choose?\r\n\r\nThe Subject Guides have been written by librarians to help you select the most relevant databases for your topic.\r\n\r\nIf you know the name of the database you want, you can find it using the Database A-Z list from LibrarySearch.\r\nSearching databases\r\nMost databases offer both a basic and an advanced search option. If you need help searching a particular database, look for the Help menu in the database to find tips and 'How to' videos. You may also find database tutorials on YouTube, and from some Library Subject Guides.\r\n\r\nFor an advanced database search, you may need to use Boolean operators. Boolean operators connect your search terms together in specific ways (AND, OR, NOT), and also help you to narrow or broaden your search.\r\n\r\nBoolean operators\r\nSome databases and catalogues allow you to combine keywords using Boolean operators (advanced operators).\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTruncation and wildcards\r\nSome databases and catalogues also allow you to use truncation and wildcard symbols.\r\nFor example:\r\nbehaviour* = behavioural, behaviours, behaviour.\r\nYou can use truncation to broaden your search by substituting a word ending with a symbol. In this example, we use an asterisk (*) as the truncation symbol. However, different databases use different symbols, so you need to check the search tips in a database to find out what symbol it uses.\r\nWildcards\r\norgani?ational behavio?r = organisational, organizational, behaviour, behavior.\r\nYou can use wildcards to broaden your search by substituting letters in words. In this example, we have used a question mark (?) as the wildcard symbol. However, different databases use different symbols, so you will need to check the search tips in a database to find out what symbol it uses.\r\nSearching for a phrase\r\nSome databases and catalogues allow you to search for phrases. Quotation marks placed at the beginning and end of a phrase narrows a search. Only results that include the exact phrase will appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n \t\"organisational behaviour\" = results with the exact words, \"organisational behaviour\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisual description\r\nNarration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ne-Books in Academic Libraries.\r\n\r\nWhat are they?

However, they do have serious limitations for academic research.\r\n\r\nWatch the video to find out more about using Google and Wikipedia for your research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo see a list of the best databases your topic area, choose your Subject Guide.\r\n\r\nUse the RMIT Google Scholar link, that way your search results will include resources from some of the RMIT Library online collections.\r\n\r\nYou might like to bookmark these!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMeet Katrina. Katrina is a health science student at RMIT University. Recently, Katrina received her marks back for an assignment and she was shocked to find she hadn\u2019t done as well as she\u2019d hoped. Katrina had done what most students do: She had just Googled her topic.\r\n\r\nFeeling down, Katrina asks for feedback from her lecturer, Professor Felinopolous. He explains that while Google is a good starting point to get an overview of a topic, you can\u2019t just use Google and expect to get good marks for your assignment.\r\n\r\nSo, why is that?\r\n\r\nFirstly, the internet is not organised. When you search a term in Google, you\u2019ve probably noticed that you get huge amounts of information returned to you.\r\n\r\nThese results are based on popularity. In other words, Google is a popularity contest and search results are based on Google\u2019s own ranking, rather than credibility or reliability. Google also knows a bit about you. Its \u201cpersonalisation\u201d feature means that your search results will be affected by your internet history, location, and IP address, too.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there is little quality control on Google. Anyone can write anything on the internet. The information may be biased, inaccurate, or have a hidden agenda. Information could also be sponsored by sources with vested interests. And lots of information is not authoritative or credible. It\u2019s not written by experts or peer-reviewed.\r\n\r\nOn Google, it can be hard to identify sources. Who wrote it? How do you verify the sources? Trying to find this information can waste valuable research time.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"In this tutorial you will learn why it is important to use high quality information.

As a smart researcher, you need to be able to tell whether an article is scholarly.\r\n\r\nScholarly articles are in-depth, accurate, well-researched, written by academics and published in academic journals. They are good and credible sources of information because the articles have been through a peer-review process. This means the article has been formally evaluated by equally qualified academics and experts.\r\n\r\nPlay this video to find out 'What's a scholarly resource?'\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-scholarly information\r\nSometimes your assignment requires you to use other types of information other than scholarly resources. Non-scholarly sources can also be useful for your research. They can provide useful information about:\r\n\r\n \tcurrent events\r\n \tpopular and community information\r\n \tindustry, trade and the professions\r\n \tgovernment policy and legal information\r\n \tregions outside Australia, particularly those that are rapidly developing or changing\r\n\r\nThey are usually written by professionals who have specialist knowledge in a field, or by people with a special interest in a topic who have developed reputation for their opinions.\r\n\r\nSome common examples of non-scholarly sources are:\r\n\r\n \tnews sources, newspapers, and materials that are time-based and get updated frequently\r\n \tprimary sources\r\n \tdata and statistical publications and compilations\r\n \ttrade and professional sources\r\n \taudio-visual resources and videos\r\n\r\nCheck with a librarian and\/or your lecturer if you are unsure of whether your non-scholarly source is appropriate information for your assignment.

You not only need to become an efficient reader but also a critical reader. You will also need to make notes of the information relevant to your assessment.\r\n\r\nYour notes should summarise the key points and record important bibliographical details like the author's name, the title of the source, the publisher, year of publication and page numbers. If you are referring to a website, make sure you record the url and the date that you accessed the page.\r\n\r\nThese details are important for referencing, and it is far better to collate this information as you are taking notes instead of attempting to track down references later. You may be in breach of academic integrity if you aren't able to show where you gathered the information from and passing off ideas that aren't your own. Therefore, when planning for your assignments, you should consider academic integrity to save yourself the hassle later!\r\n\r\nAlways consider academic integrity when planning your assignments.\r\n\r\nHere is StudyBot's advice about effective reading and note-taking. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions to ask\r\nResources to help you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tWhat should my assignment look like?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tAssessment tasks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tHow do I organise my ideas?\r\n \tHow do I integrate my research?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tParagraphs\r\n \tParaphrasing\r\n \tIntegrating and synthesising source material\r\n \tWriting critically\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tHow do I improve my grammar?\r\n \tHow do I write \"academically\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tSentence construction and writing sentences\r\n \tAcademic style\r\n \tLinking words\r\n \tAcademic word list tool\r\n \tAcademic phrase bank\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisit the RMIT Library's Study Support Hub for extra assistance.\r\n","excerpt":"Assessment tasks at university require you to do some research beyond your course notes.

However, being caught plagiarising can lead to possible penalties beginning with a warning, through to expulsion from RMIT. It's not worth it.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 2\r\nI'm really worried about my grades and I'm buying a good online essay. Could I get caught?\r\nAnswer: Yes.\r\nFeedback: Online essays are not written in your writing style so it's easy to detect. If you need help with your assessments, visit the Study and Learning Centre.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 3\r\nIf I use parts of an essay that I wrote last year, it's not plagiarism - it's good time management.\r\nAnswer: No.\r\nFeedback: Sure, you're being resourceful, however, this is called self-plagiarism. You must reference all sources, including yourself!\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 4\r\nParaphrasing is easy, you just need to change the words, don't you?\r\nAnswer: No.\r\nFeedback: This is still plagiarism! It's known as inadequate paraphrasing. Even if you cite your source, you need to change the words and the structure of the original text. In other words, write it in your own words.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 5\r\nAnother student in my class is struggling with an essay task. He asked me to send him my essay to help him with ideas. Is this OK?\r\nAnswer: No.\r\nFeedback: This is known as collusion, which is a form of plagiarism. Allowing others to copy your work makes you as guilty of plagiarism as the person doing the copying. You may even face the same penalties.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 6\r\nIs it plagiarism to copy out big chunks of text, as long as I put them in quotation marks and say where it's from?\r\nAnswer: No.\r\nFeedback: It's not plagiarism, however, it's not good practice. Use direct quotes sparingly. Paraphrasing is a better technique to integrate evidence into your writing.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 7\r\nEven if my essay passes the plagiarism detector (Turnitin), can my lecturer still claim I plagiarised?\r\nAnswer: Yes.\r\nFeedback: Plagiarism software such as Turnitin only checks duplication. There will still be a human reading your work, not just a computer!\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"&nbsp; Quiz: Is it plagiarism?

The following tips guide you through how to write in plain English.\r\n\r\nShort and simple sentences\r\nOne of the ways to make your writing easier to read and understand is to use short and simple sentences. Keep your sentences short (15\u201320 words) by removing unnecessary words.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n \tThey are easier to read and understand.\r\n \tLonger sentences can lead to misunderstandings and confusion if read quickly.\r\n \tLong sentences make ideas less clear.\r\n\r\nCompare:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second sentence is easier to read. Sometimes long sentences may be necessary, however too many make it difficult for the reader to comprehend.\r\nUse clear and concise language\r\nUse simple, clear and direct language. Use strong verbs (doing\/action words) rather than noun phrases.\r\nCompare:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth sentences have the same meaning. Using the verb 'compared' rather than the noun phrase 'undertook a comparison' makes the second sentence clear and direct.\r\n\r\n\r\nMain idea at the beginning\r\nWhere possible, put the main idea or key information at the start of the sentence to make it easier to comprehend.\r\nCompare:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn sentence 1b, the key information has been placed at the beginning of the sentence for easier comprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the example above, the tone in sentence 2a is accusatory. Sentence 2b would be more appropriate as it does not attribute blame.\r\nUse verbs instead of abstract nouns\r\nIf you are looking for a way to make your writing easier to read, one method is using verbs instead of abstract nouns. This pages explains how this can be done.\r\nSome commonly used abstract nouns and their verb equivalents are listed below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract noun\r\nVerb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimplementation\r\nimplement\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestigation\r\ninvestigate\r\n\r\n\r\nagreement\r\nagree\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscussion\r\ndiscuss\r\n\r\n\r\narrangement\r\narrange\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these pairs of sentences, the B sentences use verbs instead of abstract nouns.

Below are some hints and tools using a problem from Company Law. When answering a legal problem, it is useful to apply the IRAC structure so that you address all areas required.\r\n\r\nIRAC structure\r\nThe IRAC method has four steps:\r\n\r\n \tIdentify the issue\r\n \tRelevant law - here you need to explain the law not just state it; this could be sections\/s of the Corporations Act or case law\r\n \tApplication to the facts - the law is applied to the facts of the problem\r\n \tConclusion\r\n\r\nUse the following IRAC structure as a guide to answer case study questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample question and answer\r\nQuestion\r\nBingo Ltd is a manufacturer of electrical goods. It entered into a contract with Melvin Ltd, a large discount retailer. Under this contract, Bingo Ltd was to supply its goods exclusively to Melvin Ltd. The directors of Melvin Ltd subsequently discover that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bingo Ltd is selling identical electrical goods to competitors at cheaper prices. It appears that the subsidiary was incorporated to enable Bingo Ltd to avoid the effects of the contract with Melvin Ltd. Advise the directors.\r\n(This a five-mark question)\r\n\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIssue\r\nThe issue in this case is whether the corporate veil can be lifted.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelevant law\r\nThe legal principle to apply, established in Saloman's case is that a company is a separate legal identity from its directors and members. However, there are exceptions when the corporate veil can be lifted. In the case of Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne it was decided that the veil of incorporation can be lifted if a wholly owned subsidiary was set up by a company to avoid a legal obligation under contract.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication to facts\r\nIn this case, it appears that Bingo Ltd set up the subsidiary company to avoid its contractual obligations to supply its goods exclusively to Melvin Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nTherefore, the directors can ask the court to lift the veil of the wholly owned subsidiary of Bingo and sue Bingo for breach of contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note: This is a simple low mark answer (5 marks) to illustrate the use of IRAC only. Many Company Law problems will involve multiple issues. In these scenarios each issue would need to be addressed. For example: The first issue is... The second issue is whether...\r\n\r\nActivity 1\r\n\r\n1. Read the following question.\r\n\r\nGeraldine was appointed one of the directors of Mars Pty Ltd a couple of months ago. The company does not have a constitution. Geraldine's responsibilities as a director mean that she has to travel to the company's other offices in Queensland to sort out some company matters. Geraldine did not enter into a separate contract of employment with the company. Geraldine has tried to claim from the company her travelling and other expenses related to those trips to Queensland but the company refuses to reimburse her.\r\n\r\n2. Now read the following text and try to identify the IRAC structure. Check your understanding by clicking on the 'Answer' accordion when you have finished.\r\n\r\nThe issue here is whether Geraldine has rights to enforce. There are three sources of company law rights: the statute, the common law and the internal rules. As a matter of internal rights and obligations the parties need to turn to the internal rules. Without a constitution to provide internal rules, the corporate parties Rules. 202A (2) provides \"the company may also pay the director's travelling and other expenses that they properly incur: ... (c) in connection with the company's business\". This section provides discretion to the company regarding the payment of expenses. This means that the issue is a matter of private contract which is not addressed in the scenario. Accordingly, Geraldine has no statutory remedy and no remedy arising from the internal rules.\r\n\r\n\r\nActivity 2\r\n\r\nRead the following question, then identify which part of the IRAC structure best fits each text excerpt.\r\nQuestion\r\nDouglas Holidays Pty Ltd is a company which owns two holiday villas in Port Douglas. There are twenty members who contribute an amount of 500 dollars per annum for the general upkeep of villas. At a general meeting, the members resolved to acquire a small piece of land adjacent to one of the villas so that a tennis court could be built on it. The meeting also passed a special resolution to change the constitution to increase the annual contribution to 1,500 dollars per annum to enable the land to be purchased and the tennis court to be built on it.\r\n\r\n -->\r\nRead the following question, then identify which part of the IRAC structure best fits each text excerpt.\r\nQuestion\r\nDouglas Holidays Pty Ltd is a company which owns two holiday villas in Port Douglas.

After reading the details of the Bert V Groovy Clothing Store case, use the model plan to identify the legal issues and relevant laws.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to Bert V Groovy Clothing Store\r\nGroovy Clothing Store was recently renovated and held an opening sale in their modernised premises. A huge crowd of shoppers entered the store (including Bert). Bert decided to go to the menswear department on the second floor and climbed the stairs with dozens of keen shoppers.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the stairs were unable to take the weight of so many shoppers and one of the stairs gave way. Bert fell three metres and suffered extensive injuries. He will be in hospital for the next six months.\r\nThe details\r\nYou will need the details below to complete the following exercises. Use the case information as detailed below to guide you through this tutorial and to fill out the the Negligence Model Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBert may have a cause for action in the tort of negligence against Groovy Clothing Store (GCS). To prove that Groovy Clothing Store was negligent in this case, Bert must establish that:\r\n\r\n1) GCS owed him a duty of care\r\n\r\n2) GCS breached the applicable standard of that duty; and\r\n\r\n3) GCS's breach of such duty of care resulted in Bert's suffering loss or damage.\r\n\r\nLord Atkin's neighbour test suggested that person A owes a duty of care if B is sufficiently proximate to A. In other words, the test will hold if A's actions or omissions may affect B in a reasonably foreseeable manner and consequently cause damage or suffering to B. In this case, Groovy Clothing Store owes Bert a duty of care because Bert was in their premises and such duty of care is non delegable (and hence could not be discharged) to Groovy Clothing Store's contractor who was hired to renovate the premises. According to the neighbour test, occupiers of land owe a duty of care to their entrants (neighbours) in respect of premises because of their control over the premise Australian Safeway Stores v Zaluzna [1987] HCA 7. Since Bert's presence in the store was organised and controlled by the store, and it is reasonably foreseeable that Groovy Clothing Store's actions and omissions could cause damage to Bert and other shoppers, it is hence sufficient for Groovy Clothing Store to owe Bert a duty of care.\r\n\r\nThe standard of care owed by Groovy Clothing Store is that of an ordinary, reasonable and prudent occupier who takes reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risks of harm to entrants (not just shoppers) of the premises Bolton v Stone [1951] 1 All ER 1078. In this case, no information was given as to the standards usually required of storeowners or whether Groovy Clothing Store had complied with the retail industry's general standards of practice. However it is reasonably foreseeable that harm could occur: allowing too many people to climb the stairs at the same time could very likely cause serious injuries, especially when people started pushing against each other. In addition, Groovy Clothing Store should have foreseen (as it had intended to do) that an opening sale would attract a huge crowd to the store. However we have no information to support whether or not the stairs would collapse when too many people were stepping on it. Clearly such an accident could have been avoided if Groovy Clothing Store had simply made an announcement using the public address system or by putting up signs reminding shoppers not to rush up the stairs. Also, Groovy Clothing Store could have hired extra staff to control the customer flow at the stairs. Given the likelihood of serious harm to the stair users, it would have been reasonable for ordinary and prudent storeowners to perform the above precautions. Groovy Clothing Store omitted these precautions, failed to warn Bert and other shoppers and as a result caused Bert extensive injuries. It appears that Groovy Clothing Store breached its duty of care to Bert.\r\n\r\nAlthough a shopper entering a shop like Groovy Clothing Store would not assume voluntarily (volenti non fit injuria) the risk of falling down a collapsed staircase, in defence of its breaching duty of care, Groovy Clothing Store could probably claim that Bert was partly liable for his injury due to his failure to take reasonable care of himself (contributory negligence) on the grounds that an ordinary, reasonable and prudent person would not force him or herself up the stairs at the same time along with so many other people because of the foreseeability of an accident Wyong Shire Council v Shirt [1980] HCA 12. If this were the case, then not all the losses and damages Bert suffered would be recoverable.\r\n\r\nIf Groovy Clothing Store failed to prove that it was partly Bert's negligence that caused himself such injuries, it would then be completely liable to Bert for any foreseeable loss or damage (Wagon Mound Cases) which he suffered as a result of the breach. But for the breach, Bert would not have suffered extensive injuries and be hospitalised for six months Cork v Kirby MacLean LTD [1952] 2 AII ER 402; Chappel v Hart [1998] HCA 55. Hence the medical expenses for Bert's hospitalisation and any foreseeable and reasonable physical or other economic damages (e.g. loss of earning capacity), though not mentioned in the case, would be recoverable. It appears that Bert would be successful if he sued Groovy Clothing Store for negligence. However, if Bert was held partly liable for his injury due to contributory negligence, he might be able to recover only part of these damages.\r\nNegligence model plan\r\nUse the model plan to identify the legal issues and relevant laws, and apply the laws to the facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIssues to be identified\r\nDiscussion of appropriate law\r\nAppropriate application of law\r\n\r\n\r\nWas a duty of care owed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the standard of that duty of care?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDamages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefences\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"In this section, we are going to use a negligence model plan to answer a case study.

The IRAC method has four steps:\r\n\r\n \tIdentify the issue\r\n \tRelevant law - Here you need to explain the law not just state it; this could be sections\/s of the Corporations Act or case law\r\n \tApplication to the facts - the law is applied to the facts of the problem\r\n \tConclusion\r\n\r\nUse the following IRAC structure as a guide to answer case study questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample question and answer\r\nQuestion\r\nBingo Ltd is a manufacturer of electrical goods. It entered into a contract with Melvin Ltd, a large discount retailer. Under this contract, Bingo Ltd was to supply its goods exclusively to Melvin Ltd. The directors of Melvin Ltd subsequently discover that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bingo Ltd is selling identical electrical goods to competitors at cheaper prices. It appears that the subsidiary was incorporated to enable Bingo Ltd to avoid the effects of the contract with Melvin Ltd. Advise the directors.\r\n(This a five-mark question)\r\n\r\nAnswer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIssue\r\nThe issue in this case is whether the corporate veil can be lifted.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelevant law\r\nThe legal principle to apply, established in Saloman's case, is that a company is a separate legal identity from its directors and members. However, there are exceptions when the corporate veil can be lifted. In the case of Guildford Motor Co Ltd v Horne it was decided that the veil of incorporation can be lifted if a wholly owned subsidiary was set up by a company to avoid a legal obligation under contract.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication to facts\r\nIn this case, it appears that Bingo Ltd set up the subsidiary company to avoid its contractual obligations to supply its goods exclusively to Melvin Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nTherefore, the directors can ask the court to lift the veil of the wholly owned subsidiary of Bingo and sue Bingo for breach of contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note: This is a simple low mark answer (5 marks) to illustrate the use of IRAC only. Many Company Law problems will involve multiple issues. In these scenarios each issue would need to be addressed. For example: The first issue is... The second issue is whether...\r\nActivity 1\r\n\r\nRead the following question:\r\nGerald was appointed one of the directors of Mars Pty Ltd a couple of months ago. The company does not have a constitution. Gerald's responsibilities as a director means that he has to travel to the company's other offices in Queensland to sort out some company matters. Gerald did not enter into a separate contract of employment with the company. Gerald has tried to claim from the company his travelling and other expenses related to those trips to Queensland but the company refuses to reimburse him.\r\n\r\nNow read the following text and try to identify the IRAC structure. Check your understanding by opening the Activity 1 answer accordion folder.\r\n\r\nThe issue here is whether Gerald has rights to enforce. There are three sources of company law rights: the statute, the common law and the internal rules. As a matter of internal rights and obligations the parties need to turn to the internal rules. Without a constitution to provide internal rules, the corporate parties Rules. 202A (2) provides \"the company may also pay the director's travelling and other expenses that they properly incur: ... (c) in connection with the company's business\". This section provides discretion to the company regarding the payment of expenses. This means that the issue is a matter of private contract which is not addressed in the scenario. Accordingly, Gerald has no statutory remedy and no remedy arising from the internal rules.\r\n\r\nActivity 2\r\nRead the following question, then identify which part of the IRAC structure best fits each text excerpt by selecting from the drop down menus.\r\nQuestion:\r\nDouglas holidays Pty Ltd is a company which owns two holiday villas in Port Douglas. There are twenty members who contribute an amount of \\$500 per annum for the general upkeep of villas. At a general meeting, the members resolved to acquire a small piece of land adjacent to one of the villas so that a tennis court could be built on it. The meeting also passed a special resolution to change the constitution to increase the annual contribution to \\$1,500 per annum to enable the $land to be purchased and the tennis court to be built on it.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"This resource will help you to develop strategies for learning and remembering the course content and demonstrate a four-step technique for writing case study answers.

This is where you tell the reader what the main argument is and the topics you will cover.\r\n \tIn the body paragraphs, you develop and support your main argument.\r\n \tThe conclusion reminds your reader what your thesis or main argument is.\r\n\r\nIn the Assessments section, you can find out more about structuring assignments such as essays, reports and literature reviews.\r\nTEEL paragraph structure\r\nThis structure is commonly used for body paragraphs in academic writing. The TEEL  acronym stands for:\r\n\r\n \tTopic sentence\r\n \tExplanation\r\n \tEvidence and\/or examples\r\n \tLink (the paragraph to the next paragraph)\r\n\r\nThe Writing paragraphs page has a detailed explanation of TEEL paragraphs.\r\nKey word and phrases\r\nKeywords and concepts should connect the topic and linking sentences in each paragraph to the next. This can be done through the repetition of key words or terms, and by using synonyms (words and phrases that have a similar meaning).\r\nLinking word and phrases\r\nUsing linking words and phrases explains to your reader the connection between your ideas. For example, some linking words and phrases show contrast (however, in spite of), while others show addition (additionally, moreover) and others introduce examples (to illustrate, for example).\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit the Linking words page.\r\nDemonstrative adjectives\r\nThis, that, these and those are used to refer to something that has previously been mentioned.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n \tPemberton (2023) describes a system that could be implemented into the education of high school students. This system has many benefits.\r\n \tTo strengthen their argument, Lim (2024) cites research conducted by Abdul. However, this study was done over 20 years ago and is not current.\r\n\r\nRelative pronouns\r\nWords such as which, that, who and where are relative pronouns. They are used to link parts of a sentence together, creating cohesion in the sentence. In the following example, the first part of the sentence mentions micromanagement. Later, which also refers to micromanagement:\r\n\r\nMicromanagement is a management style which can lead to inefficiencies and high turnover rates in an organisation.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\nIn the following examples, cohesion is demonstrated on three levels: the overall structure of an essay, at a paragraph level and through the use of specific language.\r\nExample 1: Essay structure and cohesion\r\nIn this sample essay, highlights have been used to show how features from the introduction, body paragraphs and conclusion are linked together to create cohesion.\r\n\r\nExample 2: The TEEL paragraph and cohesion\r\nIn this example, one of the body paragraphs from the example essay has been divided into the different sections of the TEEL structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 3: Language features and cohesion\r\nLet's read the same paragraph again. This time, the language features that give the paragraph cohesion are highlighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nPost World War II, the increase in international trade, [linking]coupled with[end linking] the growing speed and pace of communication, meant that the need for [repetition]communicative clarity[end repetition], multilingual formats, and universally comprehensible pictographs and glyphs became important (Meggs &amp; Alston 2011). Modernist graphic design had gained strong momentum in Switzerland and by the 1950s a distinctively Swiss graphic language of [repetition]simplicity[end repetition] and [repetition]formal discipline[end repetition] developed (Hollis 2016). Known eventually as '[substitution]Swiss Typography[end substitution]', 'International Typographic Style' or simply, 'International Style', [substitution]it[end substitution] was recognisable particularly for [substitution]its[end substitution] use of sans serif typography, photography, vibrant colour, asymmetry and negative space within a grid structure, which allowed the clear presentation of complex information (Paradis et al. 2013).

Reflections identify key learning and insights gained through critical incidents in the design process and activities in the studio.\r\n\r\nArticulation of your learning through reflection supports learning-by-doing and transfer of learning from one studio to another. The aim is to identify general principles from specific learning experiences, linking practice with design theory and methods. It is common for a studio object knowledge assignment to contain three or more reflection paragraphs.\r\nStep-by-step guide for each reflection\r\nThere are a number of ways that reflective writing can be structured. One is using the DIEP framework. Here's how it works:\r\n\r\n Describe the insight: \r\nFirst, identify what the insight is. An insight is a new understanding that emerged from the studio activities or your design process. It may be a practical, theoretical or critical understanding such as a new awareness of certain factors in the design process, a new method that improves your efficiency, a deeper understanding of a particular issue, a connection between a particular theory and practice, a model that supports your interrogation of a problem, or a framework for evaluating design outcomes.\r\n\r\nThen, briefly describe the incident that led to this insight. What was the catalyst?\r\nInterpret the insight: \r\nExplain the connection between this insight and the methods, principles and theory of the design field.\r\nEvaluate the insight:\r\nMake an evaluation of the significance of this new understanding for you. This may relate to the further development of the project or future design projects, or to your design process or the way you think about design.\r\nPlan:\r\nMake a plan for how you might transfer this new understanding to future projects and\/or practice. Speculate about how this new insight might change the way you approach a design task in the future.\r\n\r\nLanguage features\r\n Verb tense\r\nVerb tense is used in reflective writing to indicate what you have learnt from the experience. For example, when you speak about your level of knowledge or experience before the insight, often the past tense is used. \r\nOn the other hand, a mixture of the simple present, present continuous, present perfect and future tenses are used to describe your current level of knowledge or experience.\r\nI, me, my\r\nIn most cases, pronouns like I, me and my are avoided in academic writing. However, in reflective writing you are writing about your experiences. This requires a more personal style of writing where I, me and my should be used.\r\n\r\nExample paragraphs\r\nThe following examples of student writing provide a guide to the structure and language of a reflection paragraph. They highlight the identify, describe, interpret, evaluate and plan sections of the paragraphs, as well as pointing out verb tense and the use of I, me and my.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nStructure\r\nQuestions to ask:\r\n\r\n \tWhat insight(s) did I gain through the studio? (Insights)\r\n \tWhich significant events, theories, methods, thinkers and practitioners contributed to your insight?

Play this video for tips on how to get your message across effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresentation skills\r\nBeing a good speaker is something that can be learned and practised. This video will give you some tips for delivering an effective and professional talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThinking about the content\r\nDo you have a message for your audience? Do you know what to say at each stage? Play this video to avoid the \u2018blah blah blah' delivery and make this an interesting learning experience for your audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour talk may be a group effort and this introduces organizational issues that can make or break the success of your presentation.\r\n\r\nIt's not appropriate to dissect the talk like a cake and distribute the parts to individual members to take care of. The body needs to be worked on by everyone collaboratively.\r\n\r\nSpecific sections of the body may be divided between your team to be deeply researched or delivered. But at some stage you need to regroup to put those pieces back together again. First of all, you need to be able to meet face-to-face preferably, and it would be good to have a regular time when this is convenient for all of you. At least once each week.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t forget to exchange phone numbers and emails as well. If this is not a familiar topic, everyone should just go there own way at first and read broadly to get a feel for the area. But sharing any articles are particularly good of course.\r\n\r\nYou need to regroup soon, and decide what two to four topics should be covered. That is, if these are not already specified by your lecturer and it would be excellent to agree on a central message before you start writing the body, if possible.\r\n\r\nIf you want a central theme, this should be defined early on if you can to guide people's research from the beginning. &gt;When the topics are decided you can go your own way and research your section deeply.\r\n\r\nKeep in touch regularly with any of the other group members, whose area may overlap yours, because you don\u2019t want to repeat material.\r\n\r\nIt is most satisfying and effective if you get to talk on the topic that you have researched yourself. You want to sound like the expert.\r\n\r\nRemember not to measure your contribution to the group in terms of minutes standing up in speaking. This is never the hardest part. The hardest part lies in the researching, collaboration and preparation of visual resources.\r\n\r\nOnce the body of your talk is defined, the group should get together and outline the introduction and conclusion together.\r\n\r\nOne person might write from the perspective of the part that they researched, and introductions and conclusions need to have a sense of overview.\r\n\r\nWriting the introduction and conclusion will be easy once the body is done.\r\n\r\nBut they are almost impossible to write in isolation from the body.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter we will be looking at part two of oral presentations a sample structure.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA sample structure of an oral presentation that I will outline here is about \u2018autistic spectrum disorders\u2019. This sample is supposed to be the outline of a twenty-minute in-class presentation.\r\n\r\nTo hold the whole talk together, I\u2019ve also thought about the central point or message that I would like to get across. In this talk, I would like to emphasise the idea that autism encompasses a very broad range of severities \u2013 from profoundly affected to mildly affected individuals \u2013 and for this reason, it often goes unrecognised when the autism is at high functioning levels.\r\n\r\nIn the introduction, I need to establish my topic and it\u2019s importance. Of course, this is the best place to establish your central theme or message, if you have one. If you have a particular reason for talking about this topic from your own work, life, or experience, that is always very engaging for the audience as well. Briefly outline the points you will cover, This is very important if you do not have a projected slide or handouts, where the audience can keep track of this. But avoid any detail at this stage. In a twenty-minute talk, you should limit the introduction to two minutes if possible.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion will consist of no new information about autism itself. The conclusion is the space to recap and remind the listener what we have touched on. If anything that is mentioned is new, it will be about the future needs and directions. The conclusion would be a great place to make recommendations about what should be done at a society level or what needs to be investigated further in research.\r\n\r\nOnce again, this could be made to tie in with our message, that some people can have some form of autism and yet many of their teachers or colleagues do not fully recognise or understand their condition because they expect it to be more noticeable.\r\n\r\nThe number of points that you will cover will vary from topic to topic. The advice is to have fewer points than too many in your body. If you have a lot of points, try to group them under three to four themes Talk about less, and go for depth rather than briefly skimming through a shopping list of ideas. If you decide to do an activity in your presentation, put it in where it\u2019s most relevant. However it is probably better to do it earlier in the body or even in the introduction. because it can pique the listener's curiosity before they receive a lot information.\r\n\r\nIf you do have a central message, become skilled at saying the same thing in many different ways. Just as I\u2019ve been doing. It would be very tedious to repeat exactly the same words of course. But, if you do it in a very subtle way, your audience will appreciate the enforcement of that idea.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany students approach writing their oral presentation the same way they approach writing an essay when, in fact, the two are completely different. An oral presentation is assessed on how well you can communicate your message or If you like, how you perform. You may get some assessment marks for the slides you produce or the handouts you\u2019ve made, but essentially you will be marked by how well you communicate your message on the day.\r\n\r\nSo, do not write pages of sentences as you would in an essay. You cannot read these out. Natural speech does not use the long and grammatically complicated sentences that you would write in a text. Your audience would have to concentrate very hard to listen to that.\r\n\r\nThink of your audience. and how you will keep their attention. You need to make it relevant for them, and not just show how much you\u2019ve read. You cannot deliver all of the information you might fit into an essay. For an oral presentation, you need to reduce the amount of detail and repeat key ideas a lot more. What helps a lot is to have a key idea, or message, that you want your audience to remember. They may forget 80% of your talk, but if you have a key theme or a main point that you emphasise over and over again, they will likely remember that. And later, it is easier to remember details in relation to that key point.\r\n\r\nDo not give the impression that you are relating what you have recently read in textbooks. Aim to give the impression that you know a lot about this, topic and that you\u2019ve been working in the field for years. You need to have that air of confidence that comes from talking about something you know really well and have a lot of experience in. Generally, this will not be the reality of course, but you can get very familiar with your topic by reading lots and lots of literature. Five minutes of effective speaking does not mean you have only gathered five minutes of information.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, you need to talk to your audience in a relaxed and natural, but still professional manner. You still want to keep on track, so dot points on cards \u2013 instead of, or in addition to your PowerPoint \u2013 can be quite useful. You don\u2019t want the presentation to sound scripted, but you still want to keep on track; so speaking from dot points is efficient because you are on limited time. It also jogs your memory just in case you\u2019re a little bit nervous.\r\n\r\nWhether you use cards or the screen, remember to look up and look at your audience. This is very important if you really want to communicate with them. You need to relax because when you are nervous, you tend to rush onwards. Breathe deeply, stop to think for a moment. A moment may seem a long time to you, but to your audience it is not noticeable.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also very helpful to indicate when a new topic is being moved onto. The audience do not have the visual cues of a new paragraph as you do when you\u2019re reading. So these shifts in topic need to be shown or expressed. A fresh PowerPoint slide indicates a new shift in topic. But sometimes, it\u2019s hard to know when a speaker has moved onto a new point within that slide. You can do this with words like: secondly, or on the other hand, or let us consider a further example. You might emphasise a new point by moving to a different spot on the stage, changing the quality of your voice, or just pausing for five to ten seconds.\r\n\r\nThe important thing is that these non-native features of your language do not interfere with the meaning of the message you are trying to communicate. Saying that, however, if you do have a strong or unusual accent; it may be wise to practice in front of a native speaker, and make sure that they can understand your terminology and what you are trying to say.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea to establish your presence in the introduction of your oral presentation. This is the time to introduce yourself and your team, but keep it brief. Most importantly, establish what you will be talking about. Remember that your audience may know very little about your topic, if anything.\r\n\r\nSo, you may need to set the scene in a very simple and general way. If you have a key idea you\u2019re building your talk around, it is good to identify that in your introduction. It always helps the audience to relate to the speaker and to the topic, if the speaker has a personal reason or a particular experience related to the topic. At least explain why you chose the topic and why you believe it will be worthwhile to listen to. However you do it, this is your chance to capture their attention.\r\n\r\nIf possible, structure your talk around a simple, one-line message. Think of one general concept that you want your audience to remember. If you build your talk around a simple message, it has much more coherence. It avoids the shopping list structure, where you present fact after fact after fact. Your audience will remember very little of this sort of talk because it presents a mass of detail and the focus is not clear.\r\n\r\nYou do need to read a lot to discover the overview off the topic, what is important, and what are the significant debates that are going on around this topic. You may need to answer questions on the spot, so you will need deep knowledge to draw from.\r\n\r\nFrom the background that you have gained from your reading, it is up to you to decide what to include in the talk. Avoid looking to one book and structuring your talk around it\u2019s headings, chapters or sections. Take a wider perspective. You are now the expert, you decide on the most interesting and important ideas to include in your talk.Because you are the expert, you determine where the talk goes. Don\u2019t tell the audience what information is in the book for its own sake. Be selective and tell them what is important and most interesting, and tell them what the literature says about this. because different research journals often do not agree with one another.\r\n\r\nActually, the topics where there is disagreement are places to be explored rather than avoided. These are often the most engaging. If you do have any personal or professional experience in the topic, that is fantastic! Draw on this as well, but be sure to make clear where ideas are from your own perspective, and what things are actually from research. Include an activity if you can \u2013 if your audience is small enough to fit in a classroom.This will allow you to have some personal interaction. It is always more engaging if you can get the audience involved.\r\n\r\nYour time is limited, so this need not be an activity on a large scale. You can get people to just \u201cthink of a time when\u201d, or get the people to turn to the person next to them to discuss something for a minute, or make list of five things related to your topic. The tighter your schedule is, the less flexibility you will have with participation. But it adds a great deal in communicating your message.\r\n\r\nHandouts may be a required part of your assessment. If you do not have a PowerPoint projector available, it may be helpful for your audience to have a visual guide or a program of what you will cover. Handouts like this can support your talk and the audience can have them in front of them while you are delivering your presentation. It can be useful for the audience to have a handout for other reaasons: it might be a part of one of your activities, or it may provide stats or formulae, because these may be difficult to express verbally or to copy down.\r\n\r\nHandouts could also add to your talk by giving further information. This may include more details that you could not fit onto your talk, .or further readings or so on. However, handouts giving further information are not always a good idea to give out beforehand because they will take the audience's attention away from your presentation.\r\n\r\nJust remember, an oral presentation is not like an essay. Do not think you would be able to cram in all the detail you would be able to put into a two-thousand-word text. You need to keep it simple, and in an oral presentation, you need to reinforce ideas a lot more.\r\n\r\nIf you are daunted by the idea of standing and talking for five to ten minutes, you will be surprised how little time this actually is when you have plenty to say \u2013 it goes very quickly. It is important to practice over and over again. And do this as you intend to do on the day. A full dress rehearsal is very necessary. This must be out loud, full volume, and with all the slides and charts you are planning to use. Practice with an audience if possible. Make sure you time yourself as you practices as well.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Watching this series of four videos gives you an overview to preparing for a group presentation, how to structure your presentation, presentation skills and having a clear message.

If, on the other hand, you decided to have pet mice, the same space would accommodate probably thousands of them.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when converting from a large unit to a small unit, you can have more of them. This means that the number increases, which means the decimal point will move right. In the example, one microgram which is the larger unit is being converted to mcg which is smaller, from milli to micro you will need to\u00a0 move the decimal point three places, and that is three places to the right. On the other hand, one mouse only takes up a small part of an elephant.So if you're converting from a small unit to a large unit you will not have many... You'll only have a small fraction.\r\n\r\nIn this example, we are changing three milligrams (which is now the smaller of the two units) to grams (which is the larger of the\u00a0 two units). From milligrams to grams there is a factor of 1000, this mean moving the decimal point three places. The number gets smaller by a fraction of 1000 so it is now three places to the left.\r\n\r\nSo when going to a larger unit to a smaller unit\u2014such as grams to milligrams\u2014the number that you have will get larger and this means that the decimal point shifts to the right.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, If you are going to a smaller unit to a larger unit\u2014such as microlitres to litres\u2014the number that you have will get smaller and this means shifting the decimal point to the left.

This means that a larger person needs a larger dose of the drug. It means that the amount you give is not a standard dosage but, rather, depends on the body mass of the patient.\r\n\r\nIn this example, the patient will need 12 milligrams of the drug for each kilogram of their body, and don't forget that this is what they need per day. Do n't neglect this last unit! Other examples may specify that this has to be given per dose or per hour, so please keep this one in mind.\r\n\r\nLet's just focus on this information first. We know that the patient is 60 kilograms, and as soon as you have a patient with a specific body weight, you need to determine how much of the drug we will give to this particular patient. We know from the dosage label that for every kilo of their body mass, we need to give 12 milligrams of the medication. Clearly, that will be 60 lots of 12 milligrams. 60 times 12 is 720, and remember that is per day.\r\n\r\nYou can visualise this in the following way: Think of the 60 kilogram patient, and then, visualise them consisting of 60 separate kilograms of body mass. To each kilogram, we need to deliver 12 milligrams of the medication. 60 times 12 gives us a total of 720 milligrams. And, as I said before, that is per day.\r\n\r\nYou can show your working in the following way: 60 kilograms multiplied by 12 milligrams per kilogram. The kilograms cancel, so that the unit you are left with is milligrams.

Flow rate is determined by the volume of liquid that passes by (into a patient) within a certain time period. This is the fundamental formula for all IV problems.\r\n\r\nThis short video uses practical examples to explain the formula for calculating the flow rate of a medication infusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorksheet (PDF) \r\n\r\nIn the simplest form, this is the formula for finding the flow rate of an infusion. You need to know the volume of the liquid flowing into the patient and divide this by the time it takes. The volume will be measured in units of some variations of litres, millilitres, or microlitres. And time will be measured in hours or minutes, or could theoretically be calculated in seconds... But this would not be a time unit that would be very practical in nursing. What is important to remember, however, is the units put into the one formula are compatible. That means that if the flow rate is measured in mls per hour, the volume must be measured in terms of mls and the time must be in terms of hours.\r\n\r\nIf the flow rate is in microlitres per second, the time will be in seconds, and the volume will be put into the formula in microlitres. If the flow rate is in terms of drops per minute, the volume would have to be in drops. Mls and drops are both ways to measure volume, but they are still different units. To have flow rates in drops per minute, you would have to convert the mls value to a value of drops before you put it in. And likewise, the time needs to be in minutes, so if you have time in hours, you would have to convert it before you put it into the formula.\r\n\r\nThe formula, as it is, gives you a way to calculate the flow rate if you already have the volume and the time. However, you can calculate any of the three factors as long as you have the other two. The formula can be rearranged so that you calculate either the volume or the time, if these are the missing quantities. The triangle on the left hand side of the screen may help you derive any other helpful formulae. We can see how flow rate can be achieved using volume on time.\r\n\r\nIf we want to calculate volume and we are given the flow rate and the time, we would multiply these together\u2026 And if we need to find the time after we are given the volume and flow rate, then time equals volume divided by flow rate.\r\n\r\nLet's put this formula to use. Here we have a problem whereby we know the volume of the liquid to be infused into the patient and we know the flow rate. The missing factor here is the time, the volume is 100 mls, and the flow rate is 25 mls per hour, and the formula for time is volume divided by flow rate. Plugging those values in, 100 mls divided by 25 mls per hour, the mls will cancel.\r\n\r\nNotice here we have a fraction within the fraction and in that the 25 ml per hour is in the denominator. So the denominator of the denominator, that is the hours here, gets flipped up and multiplies out the numerator. 100 divided by 25 is 4 and the unit now at the top is hours.In our next problem, we need to find the time again, but this time we are given the volume in mls and the flow rate in drops per minute. What is more, we for the time in terms of hours. Unfortunately, we cannot have hours and minutes in the same formula, so we will have to get our answer for time in minutes first, and then at the very end we can turn the minutes into hours, if that's what's needed. Similarly, the mls and the drops cannot exist together in the same formula, so one of them will have to change. We could turn 100 mls into 2000 drops, or we could change the 10 drops into half a ml. Either of these will bring us to the same answer.\r\n\r\nI will turn the 10 drops into mls, so we have mls in the formula. This allows for the mls to be cancelled. The minutes at the bottom of the denominator get flipped to the top again, and minutes is clearly the unit that our answer will be in. 100 divided by a half is 200, that is 200 minutes, and 200 minutes is three-and-a-third of a hour, or three hours and 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"What does \"flow rate = volume\/time\" mean?

Find out how this is managed mathematically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOur first problem is that we have an infusion running over 15 minutes and 50 mls of the infusion is being administered to the patient. We want to calculate the flow rate, and this answer needs to be in mls per hour.\r\n\r\nOur formula for flow rate is volume divided by time, and we know the volume going into the patient, which is 50 mls of infusion, and we know that it is 15 minutes for the time. But if we keep going here, our answer will clearly be in mls per minutes and not mls per hour. We need to change the 15 minutes to hours and we do know that 15 minutes is quarter of an hour. So let's put that in, even though it looks a little strange to have an fraction within a fraction.\r\n\r\nWhat this is actually saying is how many quarters are in 50? Or what is 50 divided by one quarter? Now, you cannot cancel across a division sign and we cannot divide any numbers here. The next step is to turn the division sign into a multiplication sign, and flip the second fraction upside-down. So, as you see here, the problem turns into 50 times 4 because the second fraction - the quarter - gets turned upside-down. Now there is nothing we can cancel, but we can go ahead and just multiply.\r\n\r\nFifty times four is 200. That's no surprise when you think about it, because there are four quarters in everyone and we have 50 of them. So 50, how many quarters, would be 50 times 4. And the mls unit is still on the top and the hours the denominator.\r\n\r\nThis time we have a similar problem, but the infusion this time is administered over 45 minutes. Once again, we need the formula flow rate equals volume over time. Once again the volume is 50 mls, and in this problem the time is 45 minutes. Once again, we need to change the minutes to hours. Similar to last time, we can change the 45 minutes to three quarters of an hour. This looks a little bit more complicated but we treat it the same way. It is really saying 50 mls divided by three-quarters of an hour. Like last time, we changed the division sign to times and flipped the second fraction. Three-quarters upside down is four-thirds, we can try to cancel if we can, but 3 does not divide nicely into 50, so we just multiply through.\r\n\r\n50 multiplied by 4 makes 200, and then divide this by 3. It comes down to a decimal of 66.6 recurring, which can be rounded to 66.7 mls per hour, and if you want to round it to the nearest whole ml, than it will be 67 mls per hour. We have the same problem as we had in the first slide, where we have a 50 mil infusion running over 15 minutes again. Once again, we need to turn the 15 minutes into hours, but this time we will not use fractions, we'll use a decimal. And 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour, and a quarter as a decimal is 0.25. Now, decimals within fractions do not work very well, but what you can do is turn that fraction into an equivalent fraction. That means a fraction that reduces down to the same thing, but the number inside it are proportionally bigger. We just need to use the numbers that are not complicated with a decimal points.\r\n\r\nHere's how we do it: if we jump that annoying decimal point to the right in the 0.25, it is okay as long as we increase the numerator in the same way, that is, we jump the decimal points in both numbers. That will give us 500 over 2.5, which is still difficult, so let's move it another place to the right. And, what you do to the denominator you must do the same to the numerator. And that will give us 5000 over 25. This is equivalent, the numbers are bigger but the fraction overall comes down to the same thing that we started with. And most importantly, we are now dealing with only whole numbers within our fraction. So 5000 mls divided by 25 hours... This is straightforward long division, 5000 divided by 25 equals 200. And as we expected, the answer is 200 mls per hour.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"What do you do if the flow rate calculation involves fractions such as \u00bc of an hour or 0.5 litres?

Discover what \u2018drop factor\u2019 means, and how to convert between millilitres and drops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn getting medication, we are constantly talking about millilitres. It helps to understand what a ml actually is, a ml measures a volume of liquid. If you can imagine a cube of water that measures one centimetre\u2026 by one centimetre... by one centimetre... then this is 1 ml. One cubic centimetre of liquid is one millilitre.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine that same cubic centimetre divided into 20 separate drops, drops that are large enough to pack tightly into that same cubic centimetre of space. Here we have 20 drops in that space, we have 20 drops for that 1 ml of liquid. In other words, we have 20 drop per ml. This is your drop factor for macro drops, take note of the units here because the drop factor has units, the units of drop factor are drops per ml.\r\n\r\nThe unit of drops on its own is another way to express a volume of liquid, just as you can express a price in dollars or you could express it in Japanese yen or euros, both describe the same value but they are in different units, mls or drops. You can convert one to the other if you have the conversion rate - which is a little bit like the drop factor here. But you need to clearly state what you have - weather it's drops or mls or euros or dollars.\r\n\r\nSo, if you have 1 ml of liquid you the equivalent of 20 drops. If you have 2 ml of liquid you have 2 times 20, that is 40 drops. If you have 5 mls of liquid, you have 5 lots of 20, that is 100 drops.\r\n\r\nSee if you can make these conversions: 7 ml is equivalent to 7 times 20, which is 140 drops. 10 ml will give you 10 times 20, which is 200 drops. 50 ml, each containing 20 drops gives you 5 times 2 is 10, and 2 extra zeros, that's a 1000 drops. Same thing with the 80 ml, 8 times 2 is 16 and then 2 extra zeros, becomes 1600 drops. Finally, 120 mls multiplied by 20, gives us 2400 drops.[Stop]\r\n\r\nIn short, if you want to convert from mls to drops and this is when dealing with an adult patient and you are using macro drops, you multiply the number of mls by 20. If on the other you have drops and you want to convert back to mls. You do the opposite to multiply, which is to divide by 20.\r\n\r\nFor example, 600 drops converted back to mls, requires you to divide 600 by 20, after cancelling zeros we get an answer of 30. So 600 drops is equivalent to 30 mls. If you have 430 drops and you want to convert them to mls, you again divide the 430 by 20, it doesn't go evenly this time, it is equal to 21 and a half, which should be expressed as 21.5. 430 drops equals 21.5 mls.\r\n\r\nFinally, please remember that we have been dealing with macro drops, which are the larger size drops for adult infusions. If you are dealing with a paediatric patient, the infusion may be in micro drops, these drops are smaller and they are so small that 60 of them fit into the 1 ml of liquid (where before we had 20). So that means we have 60 drops per ml when dealing with micro drops, and 60 drops per ml is your drop factor for paediatric infusions. This means that converting between mls and drops for micro drops would require multiplying and dividing, not by 20 but rather by 60.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Drops are just another unit for measuring the amount of fluid flowing into a patient\u2019s system.

In the previous video, we looked at converting between millilitres (ml) and drops. This time we are converting not only the volumes, (drops and mls) but the units for time as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorksheet (PDF) \r\n\r\nFlow rate keeps a measure of how much liquid is flowing by for each unit of time. We need to know an amount of liquid, be it mls or drops, and the time unit it takes to flow, be it hours or minutes. mls per hour and drops per minute are the units that you will commonly work with. They can express the same amount and you can and should be able to convert between them.\r\n\r\nThe strength of expressing your flow rate in mls per hour is that you get a clearer idea of how much liquid volume is being added to the patient's system. The beauty of having flow rate in drops per minute is that you can more easily calibrate how much medication is going in and how quickly. And also you can judge that visually by counting and timing the drops.\r\n\r\nIt is important to be able to make very fine calibrations like this, especially when dealing with children. In addition, your instrumentation will determine what unit that you must use and so that you need to be able to convert between the units and set your instruments according to their needs.\r\n\r\nIf you want to convert flow rate in mls per hour to flow rate in drops per minute you will need a couple of conversion factors to do this. Firstly, we want to turn mls into drops, and we know that there are 20 drops per ml.\r\n\r\nWe want to get rid of the mls so we should put that at the bottom and the drops value can go on the top. We also want to turn the hours into minutes. One hour equals 60 minutes. So we will put the hour on the top, so we can cancel it and the minutes that we want can go on the denominator of our conversion factor. So, we notice that after the cancelling we have multiplied the numerator by 20 and the denominator by 60. Let's merge those together and 20 over 60 simplifies down to one-third.\r\n\r\nSo if you have a flow rate in mls per hour and you multiply it by third you will get a flow rate in drops per minute, and that's the case for whatever the original flow rate may be, but remember that is only true when 20 drops is equivalent to 1 ml, and that this is when it's for an IV for an adult size patient.\r\n\r\nSo from this we know that flow rate in mls per hour, can be converted to drops per minute by multiplying the value by one-third. If you want to go from drops per minute back to mls per hour, you do the opposite, which is to divide by a third. But that is effectively the same as multiplying by 3\u2026 But remember, this is only true for macro drops, which are the drops used by adult infusions.\r\n\r\nLet's recall our understanding of macro drops and micro drops. Macro drops for adult infusions are of other size, such as there are 20 drops per mil. For paediatric infusions on the other hand - drops are much smaller, there are 60 drops making up that one mil, and the drop factor is 60 drops per ml\r\n\r\nSo, if we are dealing with micro drops and we want to turn flow rate into mls per hour into microdrops per minute, we can follow the same sort of calculation we did before. But we do not use 20 drops-per-mil we use 60-drops-per-mil. The difference is though, this time we are multiplying the numerator by 60 drops, and the denominator by 60 minutes\u2026 Once again we can merge them together, and 60 on 60 is one.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"How do you convert IV flow rates?

This formula tells us how much liquid-form medication we need to give a patient, considering the strength they need and the source that it comes from. This tutorial introduces the volume required formula and shows you how to apply it to a problem.\r\n \tUsing proportions with liquid solutions\r\nIf you need double the dose of medication, you need to give double the volume of the liquid that it is dissolved in and so on. This is the simple principle behind the volume required formula. Learn how you could solve these problems before applying the formula.\r\n \tConverting between large and small units\r\nHow do you convert between units? Nurses use units that begin with milli and micro a lot. If you express your dosage in a smaller unit, the number must get bigger, and vice versa. Find out how to convert dosages between larger and smaller units.\r\n \tMedication dosage by body weight\r\nHow do you deal with a unit like mg\/kg? Milligrams per kilogram means that you must give a certain amount (mgs) of a drug for each kilogram of the patient\u2019s body mass. Bigger patients need a bigger dose! Learn what this unit means and when and how to use it.\r\n \tThe flow rate formula\r\nWhat does \"flow rate = volume\/time mean\"? Flow rate is determined by the volume of liquid that passes by (into a patient) within a certain time period. This is the fundamental formula for all IV problems.\r\n \tManaging fractions and decimals\r\nWhat do you do if the flow rate calculation involves fractions such as \u00bc of an hour or 0.5 litres? Find out how this is managed mathematically.\r\n \tDrop factor: converting between millilitres and drops\r\nDrops are just another unit for measuring the amount of fluid flowing into a patient\u2019s system. Discover what \u2018drop factor\u2019 means, and how to convert between millilitres and drops.\r\n \tConverting flow rates between mL\/hr and dpm\r\nHow do you convert IV flow rates? In the previous video, we looked at converting between millilitres (ml) and drops. This time we are converting not only the volumes, (drops and mls) but the units for time as well. Find out how this is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"The following tutorials are an introduction to basic drug calculations for nursing.

It explains how to define the formula for calculating medication dosage, how to understand the formula structure and how to use the formula with practical examples provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe volume required formula combines two key sorts of values. Firstly, there are the values for drug strength. Think of that as the mass of the drug\u2026 The more of the drug you have\u2026 the stronger the dose is. The amount of medication\u2014which is often in powder form in its original state\u2014gives an indication of the dosage. Mass is measured in units such as kilograms or grams, but, of course, in medication, this is more likely to be in milligrams or micrograms.\r\n\r\nAnother way to measure the amount of mass of a medication is units. That is, there is an alternative to milligrams or micrograms and it's called units.The other value that the formula uses is volume\u2026 Volume measures the amount of liquid. For example, a bottle contains one litre of water or 600 mls of juice. Litres, millilitres, and microlitres are units of volume.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of drug, 100 milligrams for example, can be diluted to any number of volumes. You might put 100 milligrams of drug into 1 ml of liquid for an intravenous injection. Or you might put 100 milligrams of drug into a 500 ml bag of saline, which will be infused into a patient over a period of hours.\r\n\r\nThe milligrams indicates the amount of the drug that the patient receives. The mLs, then, indicates the volume of the liquid. The milligrams per ml indicates the concentration of the solution.Milligrams per ml is the unit for the concentration of the solution. A few milligrams put into a small volume of mls creates a high concentration. A few milligrams put into a large volume creates a low concentration.\r\n\r\nSo, with this formula, you are seeking the volume required... You want to know how much of the medication solution you should give to the patient\u2026 This depends on the strength required, which is how many milligrams or micrograms of the drug the patient must be given.\r\n\r\nThe stock strength is how many milligrams or micrograms of the drug there are in the original bottle, or ampoule, or capsule. And, finally, the stock volume tells us how much liquid is in the original bottle, or ampoule, or capsule.\r\n\r\nAll in all, what we are finding is the proportion of the drug we need out of what we have available to begin with. And that is the proportion\u2014or the fraction\u2014that we want out of the original stock bottle of liquid... Put simply, if we only need half of the drug that is available in the bottle, then we only need half of the liquid solution that it comes in!\r\n\r\nWhen preparing a medication of a prescribed strength, you need to know how much of the liquid solution you need to draw up. The volume of the solution required can be be calculated using this formula. Using the strength of the drug required, the strength available, and finding the volume that is available in the stock bottle, vial, or ampoule\u2026 And it can be written in the abbreviated form like this...\r\n\r\nIt is useful, though, to understand why the formula has this shape. The formula is helpful, but, what is more important is the logic behind the formula, and if you understand that for simple calculations, you may not need to rely on the formula.\r\n\r\nHere's a sample problem to solve: The doctor has ordered 25 milligrams of Drugafloxin. This drug is available in solution form\u2026 And there is 100 milligrams of the drug in 120 mls of liquid solution in the vial. Now, thinking about this first\u2026 We only need 25 out of the available 100 milligrams. That is only one quarter of the strength. We need one quarter\u2014or one fourth\u2014of the available solution. So, consequently, we only need one quarter of the liquid that it comes in. One quarter of 120mls is\u2026 30 mls. Let's demonstrate this.\r\n\r\nWe only need 25 milligrams out of the total 100 milligrams of the Drugafloxin, so we only need the same proportion of the liquid. A quarter of the original 120 mls will be 30 mls\u2026 And hopefully that is the answer that we calculate. Now let's write this down using the formula. So the fraction of the drug needed out of what is available is the same as the fraction of the volume needed, out of what is available. And now for some clever algebra: if we want to get the volume required on one side of the equal side on it's own, then we can multiply that side with the stock volume. But we must do this to both sides if want to keep the equation balanced. And why did we do this? This gives us the opportunity to cancel the stock volume on the left hand side of the equation, and there we have the equation in the form that we normally see it.\r\n\r\nThis is the form that is most useful for finding the value for the volume required, but the important message behind it... Is that whatever fraction you need out of the available drug strength... That is the same fraction you need out of the available volume of the medicated solution. The volume required is what we are looking for. The strength required is 25 milligrams\u2026 And the stock strength is 100 milligrams. Let's finish substituting into the formula and the stock volume is 120 mls.\r\n\r\nNow mg and mg cancel. 25 and 100 can cancel. 25 goes into 25 once, and into 100 four times. There is your quarter. Now we want a quarter of the 120 mls. We can cancel the four with the 120. Four goes into 120... 30 times. The remaining unit is mls. The volume required is 30 mls. We only need 25 out of the available 100 milligrams, that is only one quarter of the strength, so it makes sense that the amount of solution we need is also a quarter of the available solution.\r\n\r\nWe can understand that the proportion of the drug we need is equal to the proportion of the liquid we need in comparison to the drug amount or the liquid amount we have. We know we need 25 out of the 100 milligrams. This is equivalent to needing the 30 out of the 120 mls. Both of these proportions reduce to a quarter.\r\n\r\nLet's rearrange this equation to get the volume required on its own. We can do this if we multiply by stock volume or SV. But whatever we do to one side of the equation we must do to the other so that it keeps the equation balanced. On the left side, the SV will cancel.\u00a0\u00a0 One the right side it will remain. And there we have it, the usual form of the volume required formula. This more common form of the formula\u2013as well as the equal fractions shown above\u2013are both true. They are actually expressions of the same formula\u2026 They have just undergone some rearrangement. The message that is hiding inside these formulas is that the fraction of the drug you need out of what you have is the same fraction in terms of the liquid solution.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"This short video is the first of three videos in Nursing calculations: Finding the volume required.

The doctor has ordered 6 units out of the 10, so we need a fraction of 6 over 10.\r\n\r\nWe only need 0.6 of the vial or 60% of the vial, or 6\/10ths of the vial if you like. So 6\/10ths of one ml is 0.6 ml.\r\n\r\nHere, we have another drug and in this vial we have 300 mg of drug and it is in a solution of 15 mls. The quantity that you see below is actually a simplified version the same fraction, but I suspect that the vial that the label is on here actually has 15 ml in it. 300 over 15 is proportionally the same as 20 over 1, the fraction has just been simplified for you.\r\n\r\nSo, this time, the doctor has ordered 200 mg of the drug. We will not need the whole vial, or all of the amount, and this time 200\/300 is a fraction of two-thirds, so we need two-thirds of the bottle. Two-thirds of the 15 ml is equal to 10 ml. We will need 10 ml of solution.\r\n\r\nHere, we have another drug, and this time we have 100 mg of the drug and it is dissolved in 5ml of liquid. Once again, we have another reduction that 20 mg per ml is a reduced form of that fraction, but as we can see from this label, near the bottom, this is actually a 5ml bottle.\r\n\r\nSo, the doctor this time the doctor has order 50 mg out of the 100 mg. So 50\/100 mg is a fraction of 1\/2. We will only need half of the bottle, and half of the bottle this time means half of the 5 mls which is 2.5 mls.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, we have another drug label. This time, we have a Caffeine Citrate Injection and we have 60 mgs of this medication, which is dissolved in 3 ml of the liquid. Again, we have the 20 mg\/1 ml as a simplification of that fraction. So the doctor this time has ordered 80 milligrams. That means we will be needing more than the one vial because the vial has only 3 ml in it and we will need 80 over 60. So 80 over 60 is more than 1, that is equivalent 4 over 3 and that is equal to one and one-third. We will need one and one-third of this medication. 4\/3 and 3 ml is 4 milligrams. If we cancel the threes there, we will need 4 ml of the liquid.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"This short video is the second of three videos in Nursing calculations: Finding the volume required.

This is a bottle of water and this bottle contains one litre of water... We are going to empty the sachet into the water so that it dissolves evenly.\r\n\r\n\"If I need to ingest 15 grams of GOFUEL\u2026 How much solution should I drink?\"... Most pure drug calculations will be of this form. Our sports coach has recommended that we take 15 grams of the GOFUEL powder. How much liquid do I need to have out of the ready made 1 litre solution? Let's clarify our variables.\r\n\r\nWhat we need is 15 grams of GOFUEL. What we have in the bottle is 40 grams of GOFUEL. The total volume of liquid in the bottle is a 1000 mls\u2026 And the amount of liquid we are required to drink is the quantity we are looking for.\r\n\r\nSo the volume of the liquid that we have is given this equation: the amount of GOFUEL we need over the amount of GOFUEL we have, as a fraction of the bottle's volume. So plugging those values into the formula gives us fifteen-fortieths of the 1000 millilitres.\r\n\r\n15 and 40 is divisible by 5, so they can cancel down to three-eighths... The volume we're required to drink is three-eighths of the 1000 millilitres. Three-eighths converted to a decimal form is 0.375, and multiplying that by 1000 gives us 375 mL. We need to drink 375 mL of the liquid to give us 15 millilitres of GOFUEL.\r\n\r\nNow, returning to our formula of what we need over what we have as a fraction of the bottled volume. This is normally expressed in this form. What we need is strength required and what we have available is the stock strength. The volume of the bottle is normally the stock volume.\r\n\r\nSo the volume of liquid we need to drink or receive is given by... The amount of drug powder that we want, divided by the amount of drug powder we have available in the bottle, as a fraction of the bottle volume that it comes in\u2026 And this is the formula in abbreviated form.\r\n\r\nVR stands for Volume Required, this is usually the amount being sought in the problem. SR represents the Strength Required as in how much go fuel powder you want to ingest, or how much medication you have been prescribed. Stock Strength is given by SS, which is how many grams or milligrams is in the bottle to begin off with.

Let's recall that this is a sachet of GOFUEL, it is in powder form, and this sachet contains 40 grams of powder. This is a bottle of water and this bottle contains one litre of water. We're going to empty the sachet into the water so it dissolves evenly. And in this session, we are going to understand what the value of the concentration means.\r\n\r\nHere is our bottle with the sachet mixed evenly through... It's a nice blackcurrant flavour now. So we know that now that there is 40 grams of GOFUEL per litre of water. The concentration is just telling you about the proportion of solution that there is in the liquid or\u2014in the case of liquid medication\u2014what drug strength is in the liquid, if it is syrup-like, cough medicine, or saline for an IV.\r\n\r\nAnd, logically enough, the more liquid you administer, the more of the solute or the drug you receive in a proportional way. We can express the concentration in this way, as 40 grams per liter. One litre is equivalent to 1000 millilitres so we can express it this way\u2026 And that allows us to cancel some zeros from the numerator and the denominator, so that it is reduced to four grams per 100 milliliters.\r\n\r\nBecause four grams is also equivalent to 4000 micrograms, we can use the 4000 micrograms so we can express the concentration in this way. Remember, you always have to state your units, or else the number becomes meaningless. Once again, this allows us to cancel some zeros. And the concentration of our mixtures can be stated most simply this way. However, all of the above concentrations are equal and correct, it all depends on which units you want to use.\r\n\r\nSo the question is just how much go fuel powder does a person get if they drink a certain amount of liquid. It makes sense that if you drink the whole 1 L you'll take in 40 g of go fuel. What if you drink half of a litre, than you'll get half of the 40 g which is 20 mg; or maybe, 250 ml which is a quarter of a litre; then you will get a quarter of the total go fuel, which is 10 g. And if you had 200 mL which is a fifth of a bottle, you will get one-fifth of the 40 grams which is eight grams. Point 75 litres represents three-quarters of the litre bottle, and 75% or three-quarters of the GOFUEL bottle is 30 grams.\r\n\r\nWe could of solve these question in another way (keep in mind the other concentrations we calculated). We know for our sports drink solution that every mL contains 40 mg of go fuel; so if we have 500 millilitres of water, 500 lots of 40 mg is 20000 mg\u2014as we found before\u2014and notice that the mL cancel there leaving only the unit of mg.\r\n\r\nIf we drink 250 ml of the water, we will be receiving 250 lots of the 40 mg per mL, which is 10,000 mg; and the working out for that is similar. Now, if we drank 1250 ml of the liquid and that is more than we have in the bottle, but that's no problem because we can still focus how much go fuel we get if we had more of our blackcurrant mixture. 1250 x 40 is 50,000 mg -and the working out is the same again; and you could express that as 50,000 mg or 50 g if you prefer. But you must state the unit because it makes all the difference.\r\n\r\nSo, in all the concentration gives a measure of the medication for each unit of liquid. Using this you can figure out how much medication or in this case go fuel powder is in these certain amount of liquid. If you have one-third of the liquid for example, you'll have one-third of the medication and this relationship is proportional. What if a fraction you drink or receive out of the total, this is the same as the fraction of drug strength that you take out of the total available.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"If you need double the dose of medication, you need to give double the volume of the liquid that it is dissolved in and so on.

A paraphrase is a restatement. It is the information or idea from a text in your own words.   To paraphrase, convey the original meaning but change the words and the sentence structure, and add a reference (i.e. the author name and the year of publication).  The aim of a paraphrase is to integrate the idea into a paragraph of your own writing. This is referred to as a citation.   It is common for paragraphs to contain more than one citation. If you want to cite an idea from another text in your paragraph, you need to ensure that you paraphrase and reference that idea separately. There are examples of this on the synthesising page of this tutorial.   To paraphrase:   start the sentence at a different point from the original (e.g. object to subject)  change words where appropriate: use synonyms  change the sentence structure (e.g. from\u202factive to passive voice)  separate ideas into shorter sentences or statements.    Avoiding plagiarism You can avoid plagiarism by paraphrasing correctly. Plagiarism is the direct copying of published work without acknowledging (citing) it. It appears that you take credit for the ideas of another author. In academia, this is considered academic misconduct or cheating. Learning how to paraphrase correctly will help to avoid penalties due to plagiarism. \u202f  Sometimes you will use direct quotes to emphasise a point or argument however, these should be used sparingly to demonstrate you have understood the content.    Changing the words To paraphrase a text, follow these steps.   Read the text you want to cite; locate the idea that is relevant for your purpose.   If you do not understand the idea,\u202fdo not\u202fattempt to paraphrase it. There is a risk that you will just copy it.   Circle the specialised words, i.e. the words that the text is actually about. These words or terms need to be included in your paraphrase.   Underline the words that can be changed.   Replace these words with words or phrases of similar meaning. Use a thesaurus or dictionary for synonyms, or the academic word lists for different word forms.   You now have a starting point to construct your paraphrase. Write the sentence in your own words when you are confident you understand it.   Changing the structure The other way to paraphrase is to change the structure of the original.    Read the text and make sure you understand the main idea. Do not copy \u202fit.  Start at a different point from the original. This means that you do not copy the text word for word. Write the idea from memory.  Write short sentences and change the order of the words.   Check what you have written against the original text to avoid accidental plagiarism. You should ensure that your version is different but that you have retained the original idea.

Why are there letters in the equation? This page links to resources that will help you answer these questions.\r\nAlgebraic expressions involve pronumerals (letters) to represent values. Pronumerals can take many different values. We often need to plug our own values into a given formula for calculating our finances, and this is called substitution.\r\nThere are rules around adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing with pronumerals. Review these pages and videos to see how it works.\r\n\r\n \tA1.1 Algebraic operations\r\nIntroducing the basic skills for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (+ - \u00d7 \u00f7) of algebraic expressions. Courses in science, engineering and other fields require you to have these skills.\r\n \tA1.2 Algebraic substitution\r\nFind out how to replace pronumerals with numbers in a formula to get a numerical value for some quantity. In many courses you will be required to use formulae to calculate something of interest. The process of substituting numbers for pro-numerals in an expression or formula is called substitution.\r\n \tA1.3 Removing brackets\r\nWhat do I do with the brackets? Brackets are useful to group numbers, pronumerals and operations together as a whole. Whatever is around the brackets affects all the things inside the brackets.\r\n \tA1.4 Algebraic fractions \u2013 Addition and subtraction\r\nHow do I deal with fractions involving pronumerals? Adding and subtracting fractions always requires a common denominator (which is the lower half of the fraction). These need to be the same before you can add or subtract. This means converting some of the fractions to forms that are consistent in the denominators. It is possible to do this even when the fractions include pronumerals.\r\n \tA1.5 Algebraic fractions \u2013 Multiplication and division\r\nWhat is an algebraic fraction? The numerator (top) or denominator (bottom) of a fraction can be in algebraic form involving numbers and variables (represented by pronumerals or letters). We cover the multiplication and division of fractions containing algebraic terms.\r\n \tA1.6 Quadratics\r\nLet's take a look at algebraic fractions where the denominator is a quadratic expression. Such fractions are common in mathematics and engineering.\r\n \tA1.7 Partial fractions\r\nFind out how to express an algebraic fraction as a sum of simpler algebraic fractions (partial fractions). The method of partial fractions involves breaking up an algebraic fraction into simpler parts that are added together. This is useful in integration and in finding inverse Laplace and Fourier transforms.\r\n \tA2.1 Rearranging formulae\r\nRearranging formulas, also called transposition of formulas, is a necessary skill for most courses. Let's work on some essential skills in manipulating formulas.\r\n \tA2.2 Rearranging formulas \u2013 Brackets and fractions\r\nLearn how to manipulate or rearrange formulas that involve fractions and brackets.\r\n \tA2.3 Transposition of formulas with challenges\r\nAre you still trying to get that variable on its own from the formula, but it is in a tricky place \u2013 or maybe it appears more than once? Here we demonstrate manipulating or rearranging complex formulas, with overviews and practice questions.\r\n \tA3.1 Common factors\r\nA common factor is a number or pronumeral that is common to terms in an algebraic expression. Removing the common factors allows us to factorise algebraic expressions and write them in a simpler form. Factorisation using common factors is a basic skill in mathematics so we'll discuss that too.\r\n \tA3.2 Perfect squares\r\nA perfect square is something like \\(5^{2}, x^{2}\\) or \\(\\left(x+1\\right)^{2}\\). In this module we deal with perfect squares of the form: \\(\\left(x\\pm y\\right)^{2} =x^{2}\\pm2xy+y^{2}.\\)These forms are very common in mathematics and help us simplify expressions. They are important to know if you are an engineering or science student.\r\n \tA3.3 Difference of two squares\r\nIntroducing the difference of two squares formula which allows us to factorise expressions like \\(a^2 - b^2\\) or \\(x^2-36\\).\r\n \tA3.4 Quadratics\r\nQuadratic expressions have the general form \\[ax^2+bx+c\\] where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are real numbers and \\(a\\neq 0\\). Quadratics frequently arise in mathematics, science and engineering. Find out how to factorise a quadratic into two linear factors. For example \\[x^2+5x+6 = \\left(x+2\\right)\\left(x+3\\right).\\]\r\n \tA3.5 Completing the square\r\nQuadratic expressions have the general form \\[ax^2+bx+c\\] where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are real numbers and \\(a\\neq 0\\). Quadratics frequently arise in mathematics, science and engineering. We explain how to factorise a quadratic into two linear factors using the completing the square method. This is a general method that allows any quadratic to be factorised. For example \\[x^2+8x-5 = \\left(x+4-\\sqrt{21}\\right)\\left(x+4+\\sqrt{21}\\right).\\]\r\n \tA3.6 Polynomial long division\r\nYou may have learnt long division in school. It enables you to divide two numbers that may be quite large. It is also possible to use long division on polynomials so that they can be factorised. Cubic polynomials are the most common. Find out how to write \\[x^3-5x^2-2x+24=\\left(x-4\\right)\\left(x-3\\right)\\left(x+2\\right).\\] This type of factorisation is useful for graphing the cubic polynomial.\r\n\r\nExplore these skills in a real world context\r\n","excerpt":"What is algebra?

Keep in mind that each course may have specific requirements for what annotated bibliographies contain and how they should be structured. Depending on the requirements, an annotated bibliography may include one or all the components below:\r\n\r\n \ta summary or description of each of the information sources\r\n \ta critical analysis of each of the information sources\r\n \ta reflection of how each source contributes to the overall research topic.\r\n\r\nReference\r\nYour annotated bibliography should begin with a reference of the text that you are annotating. Check your assignment instructions to see which referencing style you need to use. If you are unsure, ask your instructor. Refer to Referencing for more detail, examples and activities. Visit EasyCite for a guide to referencing in the most commonly used styles at RMIT.\r\nHere's an example of a reference for a journal article using the APA 7th edition style:\r\nExample reference\r\n\r\nKim, S.G., &amp; Singh, Q.I. (2022). Working remotely: Current trends and challenges, Journal of Current Management Theory, 27(12), 83-96. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cmt\/2022.11.19\r\n\r\nWhat to include in a summary\r\nWhen writing an annotated bibliography, begin with a summary for each of the texts you have read. As you read, take notes in your own words about:\r\n\r\n\tthe main aim or argument\r\n\tthe supporting arguments\r\n\thow the study was conducted (the methodology)\r\n\tthe main findings\r\n\r\nThis will help you write a clear 50\u2013100-word paragraph. \r\n\r\n\r\nExample summary\r\n\r\n\r\nVisit the  Summarising page for useful tips on creating a summary.\r\nWhat to include in a critical analysis\r\nIf your assignment guide requires you to include a critical analysis, you will need to focus on the value of the material and sources you are looking into. Consider asking yourself:\r\n\r\n \tWhat are the strengths and limitations of the text in terms of aim, methodology, and findings?\r\n \tAre the findings logical and well researched?\r\n \tIs the text original, important and of a high standard?\r\n \tHow does this text add to the research in the field?\r\n \tHow does it fit into and relate to the broader field of research and academic discussions?\r\n\r\nThe following example shows how a student has critically analysed an article to identify strengths, limitations and possible weaknesses.\r\nExample critical analysis\r\n\r\nThe tutorials on developing a critical approach can help you develop your critical analysis skills.\r\nWhat to include in a reflection\r\nWriting a reflection for your annotated bibliography includes writing a few sentences explaining why or why not the source text is useful or helpful for your research and\/or how it relates to the overall topic of your research.\r\nReflective writing involves sharing your personal thoughts and assessments, but it should still be clear and unemotional. \r\n\r\nReflection\r\n\r\nTutorials on Writing an academic reflection can help you practice writing better reflections for annotated bibliographies.","excerpt":"An annotated bibliography is a list of the information sources you have selected for your research topic (e.g. journal articles or book chapters) accompanied by comments (annotations) of how each item contributes to your research.

If your group has any questions about the task, contact your lecturer as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nCreate a timeline\r\n\r\n \tAssess the time required for a group assignment. Groups often underestimate how long an assignment may take. A timeline identifies key milestones and helps you manage the workload to meet deadlines. Be realistic and be prepared to adapt your timeline as you progress.\r\n\tMembers of online groups may be working in different time zones. Factor this into your timeline.\r\n \tInclude enough time for research. Your research will be a large part of the task.

Always start with genuine, positive feedback: say what you appreciate about their work before offering critical feedback.\r\n\tBe sensitive to how others may respond to criticism. Be nice.\r\n\tUse the S.M.A.R.T. principles to focus your feedback on the task:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSpecific: Focus on actual examples of the work or performance. General or vague statements are unhelpful.\r\n\t\t\tMotivating: Give reasons to continue or change behaviour. Why is it important or useful?\r\n\t\t\tAction-oriented: Align actions with the task requirements. If a change is required, what needs to happen?\r\n\t\t\tRealistic: Is the change something that the person can do? Do they need help? Who is going to help them?\r\n\t\t\tTimely: Provide feedback when it is requested or required.

Disagreements arise when members lack clear directions or feel their knowledge and skills are ignored or criticised.\r\n \tCommunicate any problems to the whole group and try to resolve the problem quickly, as a group. You will need to negotiate and compromise.\r\n\r\nThe diagram shows how issues can often build upon one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nManage group dynamics\r\nGroups are made up of people with different expectations.

An opposing force for example will lessen another force. However, if the forces (or vector quantities) do not act along exactly the same line, it is difficult to know how they will interact.\r\nThis task is easier if you can break the vectors into components which are parallel, and then find the result by adding or subtracting parallel components. This technique is very important for resolving forces and other vector quantities in physics.\r\n \tV3 Scalar product\r\nWhat is a scalar product? What is a dot product? This is the result of multiplying the magnitudes of the components of two or more vectors. The result is not a vector, but a scalar (which is without direction).\r\n \tV4 Vector product\r\nWhat is a vector product? What is a cross product? The vector product is a vector that is the result of multiplying the magnitudes (size) of two vectors. The magnitude is found using matrices and determinants).\r\nThe result of the cross product is another vector, and the direction is perpendicular (normal, at 90 degrees) to the plane of both the original vectors.\r\n \tV5 Projection of vectors\r\nIn \u2019Resolution of vectors\u2019 we learned how to resolve vectors in two dimensions along horizontal and vertical axes. It is also possible to resolve one vector along the line of another vector (instead of along the x-y axes).\r\nLearn how to find the projection (resolution) of one vector in the direction of a second vector.\r\n \tV6 Vector equation of a line\r\nIf you want to uniquely define a line, you need to pin it between two points in 3-dimensional space. You can also define a point with a 3-dimensional vector through it. This process uses three types of equations.\r\nLearn how to find the vector equation, the parametric equation, and the symmetric equation of a line in three-dimensional space.\r\n \tV7 Intersecting lines in 3D\r\nLearn how to determine if two lines in three dimensions intersect (cross each other) and, if so, what their point of intersection is.\r\n \tV8 Equation of a plane\r\nLearn how to find the equation of a plane (a 2-dimensional space)\r\na) through three points or\r\nb) given a normal (line at right angles) and a point on the plane or\r\nc) given a parallel plane and a point on the plane.\r\n \tV9 Intersecting planes\r\nTwo 2-dimensional planes will slice through each other (unless they are parallel). Where they slice will be defined by a straight line. There will also be an angle between the two planes.\r\nLearn how to determine the angle between two intersecting planes and the equation of the line of intersection.\r\n \tV10 Distance from a point to a plane\r\nThe shortest distance from any point in the air to the ground is defined by a line sitting at right angles to the ground going straight down.\r\nLearn how to find the perpendicular (right angle) distance from a point to a plane.\r\n \tV11 Directional derivatives\r\nIf you are on the side of a hill, the gradient depends on the direction you look. So the directional derivative is the gradient in a particular direction.\r\nLearn how to find the directional derivative of a function of two variables f(x,y) or three variables g(x,y,z) at a point and in a given direction.

This short video gives you an overview of what makes an\u00a0efficient reader and shows you how to become one yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSurveying\r\nSurveying is a pre-reading technique that allows you to get a general idea of the contents of a book, article or other type of text.\r\n\r\nOnce you have surveyed, you can often decide whether to then read the text in detail, or if it doesn't have the information you need, move on to the next text.\r\n\r\nFor books and articles, you start by looking at:\r\n\r\n \tblurbs, abstracts and summaries\r\n \tintroduction and conclusion paragraphs\r\n \theadings and sub headings\r\n \tany images, graphs or charts and their captions\r\n \tchapter outlines or key points, if they have been provided\r\n\r\nWith your surveying done, you can then move on to skimming and scanning. In some of your courses, you may find that you are faced with long lists of required readings. The truth is, you are not required to read every book, every journal article, or every research paper word-for-word. Instead, you need to learn how to survey, skim, and scan texts. This will allow you to get the most out of texts, whilst saving you a lot of time in the long run.\r\n\r\nSo, how do I survey a text? Surveying texts is straight-forward; in fact, you're probably already using this reading technique without realising. To survey a text, you read the title, the cover blurb, the contents page, and the index. Then, you quickly look over the chapter headings.\r\n\r\nHow do I skim? When you're skimming a text, you're looking for just the main ideas.\r\n\r\nHow do I scan? When scanning, you're looking for the important keywords in a text, you are quickly looking for the detail.\r\n\r\nLet's look at the example.\r\n\r\n[Topic sentence] The functions of a team leader may often vary. [End topic sentence] [Linking word] Depending [end linking word] on the nature of the [Keyword] team, [End keyword] the [Keyword] leader [End keyword]\u00a0 may function predominantly in [Keyword] many diverse roles, [End keyword] [Linking word] such as [End linking word] an overseer, a resource person, a setter of benchmarks for best practice by the [Keyword] team, [End keyword] a [Keyword] team [End keyword] builder, or take on all of these [Keyword] roles [End keyword] and others (Addison, 1996). [Linking word] Since [End linking word] the [Keyword] team leader [End keyword] will have [Keyword] varying [End keyword] skills in these [Keyword] roles, [End keyword] it is likely that they may not perform each task equally well. [Linking word] Therefore, [End linking word] it is reasonable to argue that the [Keyword] role [End keyword] of the [Keyword] team [End keyword] leader is not always necessarily an asset.\r\n\r\nSo, what next? So you've surveyed, skimmed, and scanned everything like you were supposed to. Now what? Often this is enough to get the main idea of a text, but sometimes you will need to read the text in detail. However, since you now know what the key ideas and keywords are, and you have a general idea of where to find this information, you'll find it easier to read only the stuff that's relevant.\r\n\r\nSo, let's recap:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;When we survey, we read the title, cover blurb, contents page, index, and chapter headings of a text.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;When we skim, we just look for the main ideas of a text.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;And, when we scan, we look for the keywords of a text.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Throughout your time at university, you will be required to read and engage with many articles, books and other information sources.

These people include:\r\n\r\n \tteaching staff\r\n \tlibrarians\r\n \tadministrative staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents can get support from staff in areas such as International Student Support, RMIT Connect and\u00a0the Library's study support. These people are very keen to answer your questions and to help you.\r\nStudent stories\r\nInternational students were asked \"Were your experiences at RMIT different to your expectations?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMore in this tutorial\r\n\r\n \tUnderstanding referencing\r\n \tStructuring assignments\r\n \tDeveloping critical thinking\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYes from what I thought was expected of me they were quite different, academically. I suppose that's what you mean.\r\n\r\nThey were to a greater extent from what I am used to, and from what I did in my undergraduate study.\r\n\r\nI would have my lecturer in front of me teaching, and from the lecture I would just get most of the things. Whatever other reading would be mostly additional reading.\r\n\r\nWhereas what I've found with RMIT is that I basically have to do most of the reading myself. It's more like directing that they do, and then also you do most of the learning all by yourself, even just with an assignment, and then also, they use a lot more different techniques, I suppose, or styles of teaching.\r\n\r\nIt's not just the classroom situation, you do presentations, there's online stuff, it's very interesting. It's quite interesting and diverse.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the online learning stuff, some of the teaching that they do - it would be like a learning blog, some kind of a chat room, and you exchange information with your classmates, and your lecturer, and they respond to that, and you do some research.\r\n\r\nYou may do research on a topic, and you get some articles, and you come and discuss what you found on the topic, and your thoughts, and you give the links, and they, the classmates or your peers, give input, and add info to it, and then your lecturer will look at all that, and it will be graded. And that was very new to me.. very very new, especially because, I wasn't used to using computers so much. I was just used to the good old writing down an assignment, and submitting it.\r\n\r\nOnce you get past the phobia, because it can seem a little intimidating, but then you realise that well, it's either you swim or sink. If you embrace it and you face it, it's not rocket science at all, and it's quite easy to use, and it's very user friendly, and especially because there's also always lots of help and support.\r\n\r\nI think it helps to speak up. My mum used to say that if you ask you will only be a fool once, but if you don't ask, you'll be a fool forever, so it's better to just ask, even if you think it's probably a stupid question.\r\n\r\nJust ask and then you will learn a lot from peers. You will learn a lot from your lecturers too. You will learn a lot from everyone. There's plenty of help if you are willing, and you must have enough courage to ask once. Usually the next time it's a whole lot easier, and in the process you actually help others, whilst you are getting helped.\r\n\r\nYou find that there's a whole lot of other people that need the same help, and you become a community, and you work a lot more better as a team.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI think I would advise them to ask a lot of questions from everybody around them, especially their teachers, which are a major resource.\r\n\r\nI think that they should make an effort and try to find and locate the kind of students services, international student services that are available at RMIT. They are a big resource to help.\r\n\r\nI was really really amazed at the kind of services that were provided to international students. We don't have that.. those kind of student support services in our country, and later on I used those services as well.\r\n\r\nI would advise them to make an effort to go and meet these people, and explore what kinds of support they can get. If they can't get some kind of concrete support, I am sure they can lend you an ear, and they can definitely guide you towards some services which can find some solutions for you. And the second thing that I found which is very different over here, was the kind of learning environment in the classroom. It's less formal and it's less ... like somebody standing there in front of you and teaching you or lecturing you. It's more interactive, but for lots of international students it's a problem for them.\r\n\r\nAnd what happens is because they're in the habit of not participating in the class, they end up staying quieter in the class which is usually mistaken by being not very knowledgeable by the lecturers.\r\n\r\nSo I think they should make an effort to participate in the class more, and let their opinions be known about anything, and they don't have to worry that they would offend the teacher or their class fellows. They have the right to their opinions, and I think that they can express that.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn my previous study, I used to have examination with the questions, and those questions will ask you about the knowledge you have learned during your course.\r\n\r\nSo it's just like you try to write down what the teacher has said in the classroom, what were written in your textbook, but here, the assignments here require you to explore the field of knowledge by yourself, and so you've got to find out information by yourself, under the guidance of your lecturer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe semester is fairly short comprised into 13-15 weeks, and there's a lot of hard work going on all through those 15 weeks, whereas what I'm used to from Denmark is that we have a semester and then we have quite a long break preparing for an exam.\r\n\r\nIf you do the work from the beginning, on from day one, then everything is going to be fine at the end, but it is quite important that you aren't too lazy in the beginning. So what I've experienced is that if I start out hard from the day one, and kind of get an idea about how much work has to be done, and when are the assignments due, and all that, then everything is going to be fine.\r\n\r\nWe have been doing, and still are doing a lot of group work in groups, and that's a very good thing to do I think, but for me at least, it has been quite a challenge.\r\n\r\nI have been studying law in Copenhagen, which is a quite conservative way of .. degree I should say, where we don't have any work in groups at all.\r\n\r\nSo it was a new thing for me to do down here, and it has been a challenge to kind of deal with that way of working, and actually figure out how to actually work in teams, and there has been some issues that you have to deal with.\r\n\r\nAnd I'll just say that people should be prepared that a lot of group work, that a lot of assignments have to be done in groups, and it's important that you communicate very clearly within the group, so everybody kind of knows what are the expectations of the members, and that you communicate what is it that we are going to do here, and that you follow up on each others work all the time .. if you learn to do that, I'm pretty sure it will be good in the end.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI think in our classroom the international students could encourage themselves to ask some questions, because if they don't open their mouths maybe they lose more confidence.\r\n\r\nIn Australia, the students could stop the teachers speech, and ask questions if they want, so this is very different, and the teachers always encourage the students to answer questions, or ask questions, so this is a big difference for Chinese students.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Studying in a foreign country often involves new ways of learning and new approaches to assessment tasks.

Keep reading to find out.\r\n\r\nWhy is referencing important?\r\nIn 'western' universities, academic knowledge is built around different and often competing theories. One of the roles of academics\/scholars is to research and develop their own theories, which are built on their own analysis and understanding of previous knowledge. The knowledge produced by individual academics is seen as their creation or product and therefore their intellectual property. This means:\r\n\r\n \tauthors have\u00a0'ownership' of their own ideas\r\n \teveryone who uses these ideas\u00a0must acknowledge\u00a0who owns them. In academic writing this is done by\u00a0referring to\u00a0(or\u00a0referencing) the 'owner' or original author.\r\n\r\nWhat is expected of students?\r\nStudents are expected to:\r\n\r\n \tread widely\r\n \twrite about the different theories in their field\r\n \tdemonstrate knowledge of these theories as they apply to their assignment topic\r\n \tacknowledge (or reference) the original sources of their information\r\n\r\nIf students do not acknowledge the authors of their readings it is considered to be plagiarism, a form of cheating.\r\nMore information\r\n\r\n \tAcademic integrity\r\n \tLibrary referencing guides\r\n \tReferencing\r\n \tParaphrasing\r\n\r\nStudent stories\r\nInternational students were asked \"Was referencing a new skill for you?\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI found that here at RMIT that referencing is very important. Now having done my Bachelors back home, I knew it was too, and I had been socialised into referencing.\r\n\r\nIt's just that the extent to which it is emphasized here is a whole lot more different, and there's a whole lot more emphasis on referencing, and a particular type of referencing.\r\n\r\nSo you really have to learn it, otherwise you get into trouble for plagiarism and stuff. So you must learn and it's a good idea to ask also even if you knew .. like I was familiar with APA and a bit of Harvard.\r\n\r\nThere's a whole lot more emphasis on actually changing the information that you extract from the source. They really want you to put it in your own words so that was new for me .. it was very new.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI think that the first thing that comes to my mind is the referencing. That is something which is really, really stressed over here, and not as much stressed in Pakistan.\r\n\r\nIt is taught to the students but at graduate masters level, not at undergraduate level, so they're innocently and are plagiarising a lot of other people's work, and the stress over here is more on quoting with proper references, and I think that's a major thing that international students need to learn, and it's not that difficult either. You just need to get the hang of it.\r\n\r\nThere are so many online resources available. There are so many books available for that, and you can, just while you are studying, you can develop that habit of referencing everything.\r\n\r\nIntellectually, everybody should be aware of the need of understanding the intellectual ownership of somebody's work. But that is not that much stressed in our country, and we believe that if you quote somebody who has already done some work and even if we repeat that person's words, we are actually honouring that person, that we are quoting his or her study.\r\n\r\nBut the problem starts from where we don't actually attribute that work to a particular person, or particular organisation, which is a by product of their efforts, and we need to acknowledge that.\r\n\r\nIt was was an idea which I struggled with for some time when I came here, and a lot of other international students also struggle with that, and we can't seem to understand why we have to reference each and every sentence that use of any other person.\r\n\r\nAnd I think knowing the reasons behind doing that, is more of a problem rather than learning to do it, because, there are so many on-line reference guides that you can learn to use. And there's this Endnote\u00ae program which will do it automatically, almost automatically for you as well.\r\n\r\nStudents need to, especially during the first semester, students need to make special efforts to understand the concept of plagiarism, and referencing, and how does it work, and how does it affect their future publications and their future academic endeavours.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOf course I cannot come up with something and take the credit for it, if it's not the work of myself.\r\n\r\nThe Study and Learning Centre at the Learning Lab they have a very good resource on the RMIT website where there's very good help to actually find out how exactly it's going to look where are the commas put, and how do I put the brackets and all that stuff, so that's a good resource.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEverything .. the style and the actual thing, how you put it in your assignment, because you have to say, this person said this and that, and you support yourself, but for me I haven't done it so it was totally different idea.\r\n\r\nI think I understand more about how referencing works, and why do you need to reference, because it's a big thing, and now I understand that.\r\n\r\nWhy do I have to reference because, if I write something like a book or something, of course I really want to be acknowledged. So this is acknowledging somebody else's work so knowing about it is really important, finding out about it from the library from the learning HUB.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of resources that you can do, so by not knowing how to reference, how much you lose the marks is really painful.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Not sure why referencing matters?

Remember it is important to:\r\n\r\n \tplan and structure your essay\r\n \tuse the linear structure.\r\n\r\nMore information\r\nAssessment tasks\r\nStudent stories\r\nInternational students were asked \"Was the approach to assignments different in Australia compared to your country?\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe teachers here have a particular way, there's a particular style of writing that they adhere to, that they subscribe to and that they expect.\r\n\r\nFor instance if you write an assignment in an essay form they much rather that you are direct. You say the point first and then you support it, state the point, support it and give examples.\r\n\r\nFor instance whereas I would given any assignments before I come to the main point I am more used to giving more of the background and saying everything else and then zeroing in on it at last. And I would just find that even with exactly the same information, depending on how you presented it, the grade that you would get for it would be very very different. It varies depending on how you have done it.\r\n\r\nThe structure is very important. You've got to do an introduction, you've got to do the body and you've go to do your conclusion or your summary.\r\n\r\nAnd I've actually found that right here what they expect in the conclusion is a summary of whatever else was discovered. It's not a good idea to bring in new information in the conclusion. So it's small things like that.\r\n\r\nYou may have everything that's needed actually it may be all in there but it's just the way that you're putting it. At first it seems a little intimidating, I was a bit annoyed by it, especially because everything was in there. If you really took up my paper and you read all the points that were required were there, so I just was annoyed.\r\n\r\nBut then after thinking about it and listening and trying it a different way I actually realized it made reading the paper a whole lot easier actually. It made it a lot more clearer and it's easy to pick up. That way it's easy to distinguish from somebody who's not sure what's being asked and is giving all the information that they can come across or is it somebody that exactly knows what's being what they are being asked.\r\n\r\nSo you do learn even though sometimes it doesn't feel like, whilst you're going through it it's a little painful. But actually you do learn and it's not bad at all.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI would say that they shouldn't get overwhelmed by the different learning style and the different learning system. It's just how you approach it in the beginning. I think you need to basically need to develop some kind of understanding before you begin to write anything before you start preparing for an assignment.\r\n\r\nStudents should take out some time and develop this basic... clarities about what is expected out of them and what really the lecturer is looking for, and if there is some specific type of assignments that they have been given, for example like a critical essay, or a reflective memoir, or something like that then they will need to first, get clear information about what basically a critical essay is all about.\r\n\r\nAnd they can find these kind of information, either from the website, from the learning and skills website, that's a really good helpful resource.\r\n\r\nSecondly they can ask their teachers. I found that the teachers and the lecturers, they are really really helpful about that. So the good start is the key to success.\r\n\r\nThe structure of writing over here was very different. I found it a real struggle here because the expectation of the teachers was quite different from what was expected in my country.\r\n\r\nFor example in our sub continent in India and Pakistan the way we are taught to structure our essays is we don't come to the point directly we have to develop this major build up, and before coming to the point so that unless and until we don't have that huge context coming to that point, our lecturer wouldn't think that we have put enough effort into that, so but over here the thing was to go bang! Go to the point directly. And then you can start explaining OK why do you think that way, and then link it to the context and then again narrow it to the point that you initially began with and explain your opinion about that.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso, about writing assignments it's very important to learn or understand very clearly what the expectations are.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in university in Denmark it was much more writing an assignment that was the same thing every time you just pretty much wrote whatever you wanted but here it's a lot of focus on is this an essay, is this a report, is this a case study and there is lots of rules about how it needs to be done.\r\n\r\nSo it's very important to talk to your teacher, really listen to what they want. They will usually give you a structure and most of the time it's very important and it makes a big impact on your grade that you follow that structure.\r\n\r\nSo that's a big advice that you first of all really listen to what the teachers say and then if it's not clear that you ask again and make sure you know the difference between an essay and a report and all those kind of things.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere were different kinds of paper you need to write, like the essays, sometimes you need to write a literature review, lab report and a thesis, and so on.\r\n\r\nHere we've got not only the individual assignments but the group assignments as well and in China we will normally just have the individual assignments. And the style of writing is quite different.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"In Australian universities, the usual focus is on introducing the main point at the beginning of an assignment task.

Critical thinking is about asking questions and then making evaluations or judgments and is fundamental to tertiary study.\r\n\r\nSo what is critical thinking?\r\nIn some cultures, being critical is considered unpleasant and even disrespectful. However, in tertiary study critical thinking is an important skill to develop. Critical thinking is about asking questions and then making evaluations or judgments and is fundamental to tertiary study. This is also called critical analysis. Often when students first enrol at university they are more familiar with summarising or describing information and ideas. However, as part of a tertiary program students are expected to develop a critical approach to their study.\r\nWhy is critical thinking challenging?\r\nCritical thinking is a skill, which is difficult for all students. This is because students are required to develop their own judgments or views of published authors. This questioning approach may be considered disrespectful of the knowledge of published authors in some cultures. A critical approach demonstrates that the student has thought deeply about the topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps in critical thinking\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysing\r\n\u2192 By asking questions of the material you are studying\r\n\u2193\r\nMaking judgments\/evaluations to\r\n\u2193\r\nDeveloping your own position\/argument\r\nBased on your readings, lectures, tutorials etc. in your assignments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example\r\nAn essay task, which starts:\r\n\r\nCompare the theories of Author. X and Author. Y ...\r\n\r\nThis task is asking the student to examine the similarities and differences between the theories of Author X and author Y and then to judge or evaluate them. Based on evidence students are required to develop their own analysis\/ideas about the ideas of others. It is not good enough to just summarise the theories of each author because this does not show that you can evaluate them.\r\nStudent stories\r\nInternational students were asked \"Was critical thinking a new skill for you to apply at RMIT?\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere's a bit more emphasis on critical thinking here, it's required of you. And that would be, for instance, giving an assignment.\r\n\r\nFor instance having been asked to do a literature review on a topic, it's not just a question of reviewing the literature and putting the views together or organising them. On top of that you've got to critique them, and state what you think, what are your views given all the evidence, or all the opinions, or what do you question, what do you support, and why. What could have been better.\r\nA topic that may have been given, you really have to always think OK was that really good? Could you have done well without it, why did somebody come up with such a theory, and was it really necessary or they just didn't have anything else to do. It's things like that, and it can be demanding especially when you are used to just pointing out facts.\r\n\r\nNow having to go further and think about those facts, and teach you something from it can be quite a task.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThinking critically that is again an issue for most international students.\r\n\r\nI always thought that what the educationalists, the academics are saying, that is it. I don't have the capacity to actually criticise that, or to add something to it, I should just believe it as such, and for me it was really different, and when I started writing, I realised that there was so much that I had to say. And that what I had to say was also important.\r\n\r\nAnd it really helped me in doing my other assignments as well, because it developed that kind of critical monologue within myself so it was really helpful, I think.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen I recall my learning experience, I think there are two points that should be adjusted for international students who come from an Eastern educational background.\r\n\r\nThe first one is reading with critical eyes. Eastern culture emphasises to obey 'big man's sayings', so some of us are very willing to receive an expert's opinion than think they are ready too .. but not give our own ideas, and I always forget to collect evidence as I am reading.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCritical thinking is something that they talk a lot about.\r\n\r\nIt's more your ability to show that you have read widely, I mean lots of literature, and that you can hold the different literature up against each other, and say that this is where they have stuff in common, this where they are different, and build on that theory.\r\n\r\nGenerally when they ask for critical thinking it's your ability to analyse the literature.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"In tertiary study, critical thinking is an important skill to develop.

Tense use can vary a little with subject areas, so check the literature in your field for guidance. Here are some general patterns of tense use.\r\nPresent tense\r\nUse present tense to discuss findings from the literature that are generally considered factual and current.\r\nFor example: Trang (2020) emphasises that this is not the case.\r\nPresent perfect tense\r\nUse present tense to give the general background of past research and to show that previous research still influences current thinking.\r\nFor example: Research has indicated that economic factors are a major influence on the outcomes of planning strategies (Kendall, 2021; Steadman, 2022).\r\nPast tense\r\nUse past tense:\r\n\r\n \tWhen describing how a previous study was conducted.\r\nFor example: Smith (2021) conducted a review of data from 2022.\r\n \tWhen referring to specific findings of previous studies.\r\nFor example: Lee (2023) found that resource provision was problematic in this case.\r\n \tWhen referring to information or theories that were considered true in the past, but outdated today.\r\nFor example: Caldez (1932) claimed that the use of lead in paint created a faster-drying product.\r\n\r\nTest your knowledge\r\n","excerpt":"In academic writing, it is necessary to refer to research from others using reporting verbs.

I\u2019m Judy Maxwell from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University and I\u2019m going to talk about structuring your thesis literature review. There are many ways of structuring literature reviews. Some theses can have more than one lit. review chapter, others have just a few pages as part of the thesis introduction, and others have the lit. review in segments throughout the thesis. This information is a general guide only \u2013 remember to always check with your supervisors.a look at the overall structure of a lit. review.\r\n\r\nThis is the first of the 4-part module on structuring your literature review. The objectives of this module are to understand the overall structure of a lit. review and to be able to structure the introduction to a lit. review. Let\u2019s have a look at the overall structure of a lit. review.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing about writing a lit. review is to plan it so that it shows the relationship of the relevant literature to your study clearly and logically. The lit. review must be read as an integrated part of the story of your research, as you can see in this diagram. Your research story begins with the research question or questions; we also need to identify what\u2019s already known about this, how you found answers, what the answers are, and finally what the answers mean.\r\n\r\nAs with all academic writing, there needs to be an introduction, a body, and a conclusion or summary. In general, most literature reviews begin broadly and narrow down the focus. We start by giving the context, narrowing it down to identify the gap in the literature where your study fits. This is then summarised and once again explicitly related to your research topic. Now let\u2019s talk about the introduction to your lit. review.\r\n\r\nSo, what is an introduction? This needs to define the context within which your study sits very clearly through the general literature. This is where you could point out: major gaps; overall trends or prevalent themes; and mention any major areas of dissent or controversy But it needs to be done in a general way so it\u2019s not repeated in the body. Remember, you\u2019re just introducing the reader to the relevant literature. Also, don\u2019t forget to let the reader know some of the main areas you\u2019ll discuss in the body of the lit. review, and you might also want to mention the scope \u2013 that is, what you will and what you won\u2019t cover.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an example of the introduction to a lit. review. The research topic is \u2018Contesting the culture of the doctoral degree\u2019. See how it gives the context in a general way. It becomes a little more specific here, and here These sections hint at some gaps in understanding and we can assume that they\u2019ll be addressed more fully in the body. The last paragraph briefly outlines the body of the lit. review. You can see here how the research topic has been brought in to remind the reader of the central focus of the lit. review. Here the scope of the lit. review is identified as being mainly focused on Australian doctoral programs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHi. I\u2019m Judy Maxwell from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University, and this is Part 2 of the module on structuring the thesis literature review. The objective of this section is to understand a range of ways to structure the body of the literature review.\r\n\r\nThe body of a lit. review often begins by highlighting the major concepts and influential studies. We also need to look for areas of agreement, tensions, inadequacies and controversy, grouping together authors who say similar things and constructing debate with others who disagree. It\u2019s usual to gradually narrow the focus to studies closest to your own towards the end, until you identify the gap or space where your own research fits. One of the hurdles we have to overcome is to decide how to structure the body so that it tells the story of the literature that\u2019s relevant to your study in a clear and logical way, and we\u2019ll discuss this in a moment.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty most writers have is to move from the chaos resulting from copious amounts of literature \u2026 \u2026to an organised piece of writing that flows clearly.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s one way many writers attempt to organise the body of the lit. review. A paragraph on one researcher\u2019s ideas, then a paragraph on another researcher\u2019s ideas, etc, etc. But this is not an effective way of organise the literature because all it does is tell the story of each writer, not the story of what\u2019s known around your research topic.\r\n\r\nSo what are some of the ways in which we can structure the body of the lit. review? Here are some common structures that might provide the most logical way for your study, although it\u2019s important to remember that some lit. reviews also use a combination of structural approaches.\r\n\r\nIt can be structured around a couple of topics \u2013 this is common in research that examines the relationship between two variables. For example, in this simple lit. review, the topics are evident in the overall research topic: this researcher needed to look at the literature that discussed models of use and models of demand.\r\n\r\nAnother way to do it is chronologically. This is useful when the emphasis is on the development of practices or theories over time. It\u2019s usually ordered from more distant to more recent.\r\n\r\nFor example, this lit. review moves from the antecedents of building regulation (2.2) through Settlement, to Federation, to post-Federation and ends after World War II. You might notice that this lit. review doesn\u2019t have an identified introduction or conclusion. However, the first section functions as an introduction and there is much contextual information in the sections before 2.2, when the chronological information begins. The last paragraph of the final section also functions as a conclusion and identifies the link between the lit. review and the research topic.\r\n\r\nYou could also structure your lit. review through different theories. Here\u2019s a good example of using a combination of structures. Notice that there are 2 lit. review chapters; Chapter 2 discusses a variety of theories relevant to the research topic and debate, while Chapter 3 is structured around themes.\r\n\r\nAnother way of doing it is through methodologies. This lit. review discusses qualitative and quantitative studies separately. It also has a meta-analysis, which is common in disciplines such as psychology.\r\n\r\nThe most common way to structure the lit. review body, though, is around themes or concepts. Here\u2019s an example of a series of themes, moving from a general understanding of knowledge, to knowledge management, to the more specific ICT in knowledge management and associated issues and concerns.\r\n\r\nThemes are most often arranged from those more general to the more specific. But at the same time that it\u2019s moving from the general to the specific, it\u2019s also becoming more conceptually dense. More concepts are being discussed, and all with a greater intensity and narrowing of focus. This is further explained in the practice activity in Part 3. The key thing here is to never let sight of your own research topic \u2013 ALL of the literature has to relate to it in some way.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHi. I\u2019m Judy Maxwell from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University. Welcome to the 3rd part of the module on structuring a thesis literature review. Part 2 of this module showed many possible structures for the body of the literature review, but we didn\u2019t discuss the issues involved in deciding on the order of the sections and sub-sections within the structure. The objective of this session is to understand the kind of questioning and reasoning that could lead to a clear and logical structure. To do this, I\u2019m going to take you through the process that I used, outlining some of the many issues I had to resolve. Of course, you\u2019ll have to make your own decisions about how you\u2019ll order your literature review, but this resource should indicate the type of reasoning that can be useful in this process. Remember that you can pause the video at any time to help you think through the process.\r\n\r\nMy PhD analysed the culture of the doctoral degree and doctoral candidates\u2019 experiences, and I felt that a thematic structure would be the most effective way to tell the story of the research around my topic. After a long, iterative process of reading the literature and identifying and adjusting themes, I decided that these themes were relevant to the study. But this order doesn\u2019t tell the story of the literature in a logical order. What\u2019s needed is to show some sense of hierarchy. The process of developing a hierarchy begins by looking for connections. In this case, it seemed that some of these themes were more distantly related to the study and, following the general to specific idea, these needed to go first. Pause the video and have a go at identifying these.\r\n\r\nHow did you go? It\u2019s not always as easy as it looks. I started by realising that these five themes helped to contextualise the study and needed to go first. But there\u2019s an obvious problem here with having recent innovations first, and the more general development of the doctoral degree last. The themes needed to be reordered to show the context more logically. The development of the doctoral degree has a historical focus so it seemed logical to discuss this first.\r\n\r\nDefinitions are usually also discussed at the beginning, and maybe this could have gone before the development, but in this case I placed it after it because the definition is complex - there are many types of doctoral degrees. And because this research is based on three different doctoral degrees, this theme is clearly more specific to the research topic than the general history of the doctoral degree in Australia. I decided to put the value of the doctoral degree right after defining it, because it\u2019s contested in a similar way to the definition. Recent innovations were discussed next because they\u2019re more closely related to the study topic. And only then could I discuss the tensions and contradictions in these recent innovations. Now let\u2019s have a look at the themes that are more closely related to the study topic. I realised that the themes seemed to fit into three logical groups. One is to do with supervisors \u2013 these themes both relate to this. Another is more directly related to candidates\u2019 experiences. And the third group relates to other issues in doctoral study.\r\n\r\nNow I at least had some rough organisation, but then I needed to check the order of these three groups. These are more general issues in doctoral practice so, following the general to specific idea, I put them before the more closely related issue of candidates and supervisors. Because the main focus of the study is candidates\u2019 experiences, these needed to go last. Then I needed to review the order within these three groups.\r\n\r\nIn the first group it didn\u2019t seem to matter which order these were put in (and sometimes, there really is no logical way of ordering themes). However, the literature around these themes showed that the factors impacting on successful completion relied on an understanding of student diversity. Writing issues is a little more specific to the research and seemed to work best at the end of this group.\r\n\r\nIn the themes related to supervision, again, at first there didn\u2019t seem to be any reason for any particular order. However, the literature revealed a strong argument that the practice of supervision is under-theorised, so it worked better this way around.\r\n\r\nNow we come to the last group and, this time, there was no particular reason for changing this order other than my preference for discussing the positives before the negatives.\r\n\r\nSo now I had a list of themes in a clear and logical order. But there\u2019s another issue I had to think about. Although I had created three groups of themes, there was nothing to hold the groups together, so I needed to create headings for them. And then I needed to show the hierarchy between the headings and the subheadings by indenting the latter. And then, of course, I needed to have an introduction at the beginning and a conclusion or summary at the end. And in this case, I decided on a section explicitly relating the literature to the study.\r\n\r\nIn a final check, though, I realised that all the themes and sub-themes from \u2018Issues in doctoral practice\u2019 to the end are all issues in doctoral practice, but the hierarchy doesn\u2019t show this. I needed to show all of the remaining themes as a sub-set of \u2018Issues in doctoral practice\u2019 by indenting them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHi. I\u2019m Judy Maxwell from the Study and Learning Centre at RMIT University and this is Part 4 in the series on structuring a thesis literature review. The objective of this section is to identify the elements of a typical literature review conclusions or summary section.\r\n\r\nNow you\u2019ve put the body into a logical order, it\u2019s time to ask \u2018So what!\u2019 In the conclusion or summary you discuss the significance of the key literature and evaluate the body of knowledge generally. You can do this by summarising the key literature and major contributions, and identifying general inconsistencies and gaps in the lit. Once again, don\u2019t forget to relate this to your research question or problem.\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s look at a couple of examples of lit. review conclusions. You can see here where the major contributions of significant research have been identified. Then the gaps in research are identified, and finally, the lit. review is related to the present study by showing how the gaps will be filled. Here\u2019s another example of conclusions. The first paragraph summarises the major research in a general way. This is made more explicit in the second paragraph, and the last paragraph rounds off the chapter with a hint of what\u2019s next: Bourdieu\u2019s ideas are explained in the very next chapter.\r\n\r\nBecause the literature is summarised, there are no citations in either this or the previous example, and it\u2019s important not to bring in any new lit. into the conclusions. One or two examples of key literature are sometimes cited, but this would already have been discussed in the body. There\u2019s also no discussion of gaps or inconsistencies in the literature here, because in this case the last section of the body of the lit. review has fully discussed these.\r\n\r\nFollowing on from the previous example, here are first three paragraphs from the section before the conclusion section. You can clearly see that each paragraph discusses the gap in the literature, and that each of these is related to how the current study will attempt to address these gaps. It also identifies the main focus of the literature and justifies the current study by highlighting a key concern in the literature.\r\n\r\nSo what now? The best way you can get a feel for what\u2019s possible in your lit. review is to read others, particularly from the same subject area. You\u2019ll find other databases of theses in your library. If you\u2019re an RMIT student, a good starting place is the guide to finding and obtaining thesis. Here are also some other online resources you might find useful.\r\n\r\nHere are some guiding questions to help you when you read other theses. This brings us to the end of the presentation. Now it\u2019s up to you to put this into practice in your own lit. review. To get a complete picture of how to structure your thesis lit. review, it\u2019s important to look at each of the four parts of this module, but remember that writing conventions differ between disciplines, and you still need to be guided by your supervisor. We wish you well in your studies.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Watch a series of four videos explaining how to structure a literature review.

The videos, tutorials and links on this page will get you off to a strong start.\r\n\r\nGetting started\r\n\r\nChoose, define and refine your topic\r\nDo you have the question or topic for your literature review clearly defined? A lot of time and effort can be wasted unless you do. View this video to break through that starting barrier, find a direction and get your literature review on track.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research timeline\r\nDo you spend hours (if not weeks) printing off more information than you will ever need for your assignment? Thorough research is important but some students get stuck at this stage. Stop the madness and watch this video to see how to keep the research process efficient, effective and moving forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s explore the levels of thinking that are required for writing a good critical literature review. Writing a critical literature review requires more than just setting forth lots of facts collected from different sources. Benjamin Bloom developed his taxonomy - that is a classification system - of cognitive levels. The lower levels of knowledge, comprehension and application are simply knowing stuff, understanding what it is about, and knowing how to use it.\r\n\r\nAt tertiary level, however, we are expected to work at the levels above this, namely analysis where you pull an idea or a concept apart to find out what it is about; synthesis is where you take different ideas from different sources and combine them into a new understanding, and you do a lot of this in a literature review. And finally, evaluation, where you keep a critical eye open, make judgements on what you read or hear, and even accept or reject the ideas with your reasoning of why you did so.\r\n\r\nThis is something you need to do in a critical literature review. You are encouraged to be judicious on the validity or the importance of a writer\u2019s opinion, as long as you have sound arguments in support of your decisions. The point here is: you need to do more than to collect and organise already existing information. This means that you are operating within the lower three levels of Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy, and this is less than what you are expected to do in higher education. You need to create a new overall understanding or a new insight into an issue. Creating new knowledge is what the upper three levels are about. In a literature review, you are not creating new knowledge in terms of experimental data, of course, but you are creating your own interpretation of the information that is available.\r\n\r\nIt is most important to choose your topic wisely in the first place. Choose a topic that actually is arguable. If there is no dissent or controversy about an issue, procedure or theory, you will find that you\u2019ll be reproducing accepted facts and there will be no room - or reason - to take a stand one way or the other. On some topics, not all researchers are of all the same opinion. They may agree in part, but vary on the details, or they may in fact be diametrically opposed. These disagreements are to be relished, rather than avoided, because it affords plenty of room to make sense of it yourself, and that makes the topic much more interesting.\r\n\r\nIf you were to choose something in the area of mental health for example, such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, there is little point telling your readers what these conditions entail - this has already been done. The extent to which these conditions could be moderated with diet for example, is still opened to question. And this question is, therefore, worth exploring.\r\n\r\nIf you can, choose a topic that has relevance and importance. This does not mean that it has to about finding the cure for cancer. The question of whether handwashing with soap and water is better than hand rubbing with anti-bacterial gel, for example, may sound insignificant at first, but it is hugely relevant to a wide number of health professionals. Therefore, this question matters! And, incidentally, there is a broad spectrum of opinions about this question on both sides.\r\n\r\nFinally, just to keep yourself on track, turn your topic into a question. A general topic - such as the benefits of hand rubbing - does not imply a specific focus, and you can easily end up collecting a large amount of information on this subject. If you turn your topic into a question such as, \u201cis hand rubbing more effective than handwashing?\u201d, or more specifically, \u201cis hand rubbing the more effective method in the operating theatre environment?\u201d, this gives you something to to respond to; it keeps you on a defined path.\r\n\r\nWhen told to choose something controversial, this means simply arguable, and something for which there is not one widely accepted point of view. It does not necessarily mean to choose one of the socially controversial topics, such as abortion or euthanasia. In fact, I would be very wary of doing so, unless you feel equipped to argue using philosophy, ethics, social theory or theology. Many of these issues have a large moral component and for an academics essay, you would be expected to draw on these sources to make your points.\r\n\r\nWhether you feel something is right or wrong is not enough in an academic text. These emotive topics can easily diverge from the field of medical science into ethics, unless you define your question very clearly to keep them there. Lastly, it is a literature review and not a commonwealth-funded task force - you don\u2019t need to solve the problem, or even come up with recommendations necessarily. For a literature review, you are required to say what the experts have already said on your chosen issue. Just find what is already out there in the literature, and help your reader make sense of the wide variety of the perspectives.\r\n\r\nCluster your literature around common themes or threads of ideas. Structure your writing thematically and not author by author. This allows you to compare, contrast, and make sense of the different authors\u2019 perspectives on one point.\/ And if you find there are a lot of authors with some contribution to one point, then maybe that point needs to be teased out into sub-themes.\r\n\r\nTry not hide behind what the literature is saying. Remember, it is up to you to interpret it and make sense of it for your reader. Listing what they have found or believe is part of a literature review, but in itself is not enough, you need to clarify what the reader is to take away from this body of research.\r\n\r\nNever be afraid to narrow your topic. You have a word limit, which is enough to make one meaningful point, but not to include detail for its own sake. It is better to dig deep into a topic rather than be broad and superficial. Make your question more specific, such as, \u201cis hand-rubbing more effective in operating theatres?\u201d, or \u201ccan diet moderate schizophrenia at onset?\u201d.\r\n\r\nYou may have to limit you question many times before you submit your draft. This does not diminish the quality of your research, it actually enhances it. So, think long and hard about your question, because this provides the guidelines for your writing and your research. You need to have clear guidelines so that you can research with purpose and efficiency, even if these guidelines get modified at a later date. Otherwise a lot of time and energy will be wasted, either, looking at irrelevant material, or material that cannot fit into your review.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re writing on a topic that you know little about, it is worthwhile to get acquainted with the area before you define your question. This means reading generally and broadly but with the aim of moving towards a more targeted search. Avoid getting comfortable in this general reading phase, you need to move beyond this as soon as you can by defining the question yourself \u2013 even a tentative one \u2013 so that you can start making progress.\r\n\r\nIf necessary, set a date to turn your contemplation into action. Once you\u2019ve defined a question, you have automatically narrowed the field. You will start to know what you are looking for, and will feel less overwhelmed by the massive amount of information at your fingertips. If you are feeling overwhelmed, it is likely that you do not have a clear enough idea of what you are looking for. Then, you need to revisit and perhaps refine your question.\r\n\r\nAfter your general reading and defining some question, time for a brainstorm. Put everything down on a large sheet of paper. Use mind maps or lists to see what you can explore. But a mind map will lose form very quickly, if there is no purpose or question underpinning it.\r\n\r\nReading, writing, refining and redefining your topic are all cyclic and interlinked parts of your research process. Don\u2019t wallow in the information collecting phase for too long though; the writing process clarifies your thoughts and therefore the outline of the review. When you know what you are looking for, you can go back to the literature.\r\n\r\nThis may open up new avenues to explore, which again, may mean redefining your question. The notes you make are only raw material only when you put them into paragraph form, and until then, they have no place or function. The only thing more effective than defining a question is to start getting something down on paper, and this will really make your searches more targeted, because your information gaps will be made obvious.\r\n\r\nEven if you don\u2019t feel ready to call it your first draft, call it \u201cdraft minus 10\u201d. The process of writing is a huge part of clarifying your own thoughts, and giving your writing a direction. The early stages of mainly researching will transition to mainly writing with very specific searching. But on the whole, writing and researching have a symbiotic interaction throughout.\r\n\r\nAfter all, a bird does not build its nest by collecting a huge number of twigs, stop, and frantically assemble them in one day. However, many students research and write their essays just in that way. The bird starts with the basic structure of their nest early on, and collects and build things as needed. We could learn from this example in our own writing \u2013 put pen to paper as soon as possible. Writing is part of the research process, it is not the end point.\r\n\r\nYou have now complete the Literature Review module. We hope you have enjoyed the content.

This page gives you some tips for how to get started using these techniques.\r\n\r\nSkimming\r\nThis involves reading through a text quickly to get a general idea of its contents. To skim, do not read every word. Rather, pay attention to:\r\n\r\n \tkey words and phrases\r\n \tnumerical data and dates\r\n \tcapitalised words and phrases\r\n \tbulleted points and numbered lists\r\n \tanything in bold or italicised\r\n\r\nThese features often highlight important information.\r\n\r\nNote: for core texts that you must understand thoroughly, this reading technique may not be appropriate.\r\nScanning\r\nThis technique also involves going through a text quickly to find specific information. Again, you will not read every word. Instead, you read quickly until you come to the information you are looking for, and then you stop to read the information more carefully.\r\n\r\nBefore you scan a text, it is a good idea to have an idea of what you are looking for. For example, you might need to find statistics, or you might have some key words or phrases you need to find information about.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, let's imagine that you are studying the topic of censorship, and you have found an article to read. You might make a list of key words to look for that includes:\r\n\r\n \tcensor \/ censorship \/ censoring\r\n \tmedia suppression\r\n \tsilencing of media\r\n \tcorrupt \/ corruption\r\n\r\nWhen doing this, keep a look out for variations of the key words and phrases that might also appear in the text.\r\nExamples of skimming and scanning strategies\r\n\r\nRead the topic sentence for the main idea\r\nThe topic sentence of a paragraph tells the reader what the main idea is. It is usually the first sentence of a paragraph. Can you identify the topic sentence in this passage?\r\nThe Australian preferential voting system ensures the chosen candidate reflects the choice of most voters. In this system, voters rank candidates in order of preference on their ballots, instead of picking just one (Liu, 2024). For example, if no candidate gets more than half of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the least votes is removed. Consequently, their votes are given to the next preferred candidate on those ballots. Therefore, this process helps to ensure that the winning candidate has wider support among voters.\r\n\r\nScan for key words\r\nImagine that you are studying a degree in politics and you need to find information on preferential voting systems. See if you can find any key words that relate to the topic in this passage:\r\nThe Australian preferential voting system ensures the chosen candidate reflects the choice of most voters.

For example, if no candidate gets more than half of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the least votes is removed. Consequently, their votes are given to the next preferred candidate on those ballots. Therefore, this process helps to ensure that the winning candidate has wider support among voters.\r\n\r\nSkimming and scanning knowledge test\r\n\ufeff \r\n","excerpt":"Skimming and scanning are time-saving reading techniques that allow you to find the information you need without reading full texts.

While the information is still fresh in your mind, it\u2019s recommended that you organise it in a logical way. By doing this, it is less likely that you will need to go back and read the full text again; rather, you will be able to look at your notes to remember what you have learned.\r\nHow you do this depends on you and how you best retain information. Here are some ways to organise your notes:\r\nCreate a filing or tagging system\r\nHave you read something that gave you a new understanding of a topic? Or perhaps something that could be useful in the future? Or something that was not obviously relevant to what you are studying at the moment?\r\n\r\nYou could create a filing or tagging system to sort information into categories so that you know how it may be useful in the future. One way is to organise what you have read into topics, and another is to use tags such as:\r\n\r\n \tmust read\r\n \tuseful\r\n \tuse for assignment 1 \/ assignment 2\r\n \tnot immediately useful\r\n\r\nThen you have a few options. You could set up a folder with each of these names, or this information could be added into a file name, for example: The Science of Life- journal article- must read\r\n\r\nRemember that even if something is not obviously useful for the time being, it could be useful in the future. So, make sure you have your notes filed away so that they can be found if you need them.\r\nMind mapping\r\nMind maps are a great way to represent information visually as they show how issues or topics relate to each other. The  mind mapping page on the Learning Lab has information about how to get started with this technique.\r\nTables\r\nWhen used properly, tables can present information in clear and easily readable way. For example, you can include the publication details of the text you are reading, such as the author\u2019s name, the title and year of publication in one row. Then, you can have one column where you record the major themes and pages numbers, and a larger column where you write notes that come under those themes.\r\nCreate a glossary of new terms\r\nDid you come across some new terms in your reading? By creating a glossary of terms, you can keep track of the new concepts that come up in your reading. This can be as easy as creating a table with two columns in a Word document.\r\nMake a mock presentation\r\nAnother option for organising your notes it to pretend that you need to give a presentation about the article you have read. In this technique, you can create a PowerPoint or other type of presentation, write the publication details on the title slide, and then use the main themes that emerge as the titles for the subsequent slides, followed by dot points that expand on those themes. If visuals help you learn, you could include relevant images on the slides, or graphs, charts or tables that help bring the information to life.\r\nWrite a summary\r\nA typical way of organising information is to summarise it. In this technique, you can not only write down what the major themes of the text are, but also give an idea of what you thought about it, and how it might be useful to you in the future. By doing this, when you come back to the text after weeks or months, you will quickly be able to decide if it is something you should spend time re-reading, or if you should move on to another text.","excerpt":"Now that you\u2019ve done some reading, it\u2019s time to think about how you will organise this information so that you can use it to remember important points and concepts and so that it can be easily accessed should you need it in the future.

It covers the introduction, report structure and organisation, writing the report, and business writing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Introduction   [slide 1: Topic slide]   [slide 2: Outline]   Description:   Sitting at the centre of the screen is: \u201cWhat am I going to be learning today?\u201d The following four words animate in:   - Introduction   - Report structure and organization   - Writing the report   - Business writing   Narration:   This resource covers three important features of the writing required for a successful business research report. Following this brief introduction, the second section covers report structure with a focus on suitable ways   to organize content. The third section outlines the features of persuasive writing. And the final section provides tips for strong effective business writing.   [slide 3: What is a business research report?]   Description:   A checklist of items that make up a research report:   - Formulates a research   - Reports on research findings   - Recommends actions to achieve desirable outcomes   And is written in a   - Business report format   - Professional business writing style   Narration:   This assignment provides you with the opportunity to research and write a real workplace report. It will inform the client of important aspects of their research brief. It will also provide recommendations to achieve desirable outcomes. The report will be presented as a written business proposal and as a presentation. This assignment requires a transition from academic writing to professional business writing. A business research report is written in a professional business style that differs from academic writing.   Report structure and organization   [slide 4: Topic slide]   [slide 5: Linear text structure]   Description:   [Graphic] Three babushka dolls representing each of the following:   - Whole text   - Section   - Paragraph   Narration:   Overall, reports have a highly structured linear form with a beginning, middle and an end. This is repeated at the section level and the paragraph level.   [slide 6: Part: 1 - Organising content]   Description:   A report structure should be broken down into sections, having a beginning, middle and end. An example of this is:   Beginning   - Executive summary   - Introduction   - Research question   - Problem, context and literature   Middle   - Methodology, approach and limitations   - Discussion and data analysis   - Implications (benefits and limitations)   End   - Recommendation and conclusion   - Considerations of policy adjustments and recommendations for further research   - References   A numbering system is used for the table of contents, and within them a broad example of a research page appears. Here it emphasizes the use of TEEL, and how each paragraph should be linked with one another.   Narration:   Reports are structured using sections that are clearly organized and use a numbering system. Paragraphs within the sections should be well structured   and ideas should be linked between paragraphs.   [slide 7: Part: 2 - Organising content]   Description:   An example of going from general to specific.   - Current trend for businesses to outsource non-core activities   - Increase in demand for Facilities Management (FM) services   - More integrated and strategic approach to providing FM services   - Business now delivers a range of services through a single contract. These include\u2026   Narration:   General to specific is a useful strategy for organising content in business writing. This is particularly helpful for giving background or an overview.   [slide 8: Report sections]   Description:   [Text] We will now go through each of the report sections in detail:   Example. Report structure and headings.   - Report title and authors names   - Executive summary   - Introduction   - Research question   - Problem, context and literature   - Methodology, approach and limitations   - Discussion and data analysis   - Implications (benefits and limitations)   - Recommendations and conclusions   - Consideration of policy adjustments and recommendation for further research   - References   Narration:   No narration.   [slide 9: Executive summary]   Description:   [Text]   - Briefly summarise the whole report in a logical order   - Outlines context, rationale, objectives, findings, conclusions, recommendations   - Written last, mainly in past tense   Narration:   A strong executive summary is vital to a successful report as it determines the relevance of the report for the reader. It is the section the reader reads first and provides an overall summary of the whole report. Each major section of the report should be summarised in 1 or 2 sentences.   [Slide 10: Introduction]   Description:   [Text]   - Identifies the main context and issues   - Narrows to project aim\/purpose   [Text and graphic example]   Graphic of a triangle point downwards, writing from a general to specific.   Accompanying this the following text:   General (top of the triangle): \u2018PICA is a property and financial services company currently offering\u2026\u2019   Specific (bottom of the triangle): \u2018PICA requires a business plan for\u2026.\u2019   Narration:   Notice how the introduction narrows the topic from its broader context to the specific purpose of this report. The introduction is written from general to specific, which is a common form found in business writing.     [slide 11: Research question]   Description:   [Text]   Frames the whole report   [Text example]   This report aims to answer the question \u2018Is now a good time for PICA to diversify into Facilities Management (FM)\u2019?   - Sub-questions   - Sub-questions   - Sub-questions   Narration:   This research question frames the whole report and focuses the research to a specific area. It is common to have one research question followed by sub questions and these emerge from the larger question being answered.   [slide 12: Problem, context and literature]   Description:   [Text]   Outlines the general situation in the specific business area   - Definitions   - Competitors   - Financial background   [Graphic]   The accompanying graphic is of the triangle representation pointing downwards from general to specific.   Narration:   Problem, context and literature section of the report requires a general   Introduction to the business which then narrows to cover details of competitors and their financial background. Again you are writing from general to specific.   [slide 13: Methodology, approach and limitations]   Description:   [Text]   How?   The research uses an applied strategy with a change focus (Saunders, Lewis &amp; Thornhill 2012).   Why?   The main approach is data collection will be This methodology is appropriate because\u2026.   Details   The research is based on secondary data, both qualitative and quantitative   Limits   Limitations in the research include\u2026   Narration:   The methodology covers how the research was done, why these methods were chosen, the details of the methods used and the limits of stating explicitly what is covered and what is not.   [slide 14: Discussion and data analysis]   Description:   [Text]   Refer to your research   - Limitations in the research include\u2026   Compare to theory \/ other research   - Industry bodies and secondary research\u2026   - Eg.  This strategy encompasses all aspects of financial reporting (Faulding &amp; Lau 2011)\u2026    Sum up at the end of each section   - In summary, Sydney is well positioned for further growth in residential buildings that require FM services\u2026   Narration:   It is important to refer to your research to show links between the primary research. In this case industry bodies, secondary research such as academic papers, theory and research and your findings.   [slide: 15: Implications: benefits and limitations]   Description:   [Text]   What do your findings mean for the client?   - The findings outlines above suggests that PICA\u2019s desire to enter the FM industry is expected to be beneficial given that\u2026   - NSW trends demonstrate\u2026   - Evidence suggests that PICA will be required to \u2026   - There are risks associated with entering the FM services market.   Narration:   It is important to refer to your research to show links between the primary research. In this case industry bodies, secondary research such as academic papers, theory and research and your findings. You need to explain what your research findings mean for your client. These implications will lead into your recommendations in the next section.   [slide 16: Recommendations and conclusions]   Description:   [Text and Graphic]   Conclusion   - Restates purpose   - Provides \u2018the answer\u2019   - Provides a concluding statement   The accompanying graphic of a triangle representation, this time with it points upward -going from specific to general.   [Text]   Recommendations   - Suggests steps for further action   Eg. It is recommended that:   o PICA should enter the FM market   o Pica should acquire new\u2026   Narration:   The conclusion should provide a clear answer to the research question.   The conclusion is the reverse of the introduction it moves from answering the specific research question to showing how it fits into the broader context. In the recommendation section we return to the steps that this specific business should be taking as a result of the report.   [slide 17: Recommendation for further research]   Description:   [Text]   Outline other research   - Based on the research findings, it is recommended that further in-depth analysis be conducted of the competitive landscape.   - PICA should seek legal and tax advice in order to\u2026   Broadening the scope of the research   Examining certain issues in detail   Narration:   In the final section of your report, outline what other research you think the client should undertake. This could include broadening the scope of the current research or examining certain issues in more detail.   Writing the report   [slide 18: Topic slide]   [slide 19: Paragraphs: TEEL]   Description:   [Graphic and Text]   Buns top and bottom: Topic and linking sentence   Condiments and meat: Explanation, evidence and examples   [Text]   TEEL can be described using a burger metaphor. The topic and linking sentences make up the bun and base of the burger, and the evidence and explanations make the filling.   Narration:   A paragraph contains one main idea, which is found in the topic sentence.   It is best to put the topic sentence first in the paragraph as this makes reading easier. The rest of the paragraph is made up of explanation and evidence to support the topic sentence.   [slide 20: Paragraph structure: TEEL]   Description:   [Text example]   A sample of a paragraph structure is given using the TEEL structure; each of these parts is highlighted.   [Topic] Leighton Contractors is a large-scale FM operation with considerable FM expertise within its own group of companies [end-topic]. [Example] A brief analysis of Leighton\u2019s focus is helpful to PICA as it considers entry to the FM industry as PICA is considering a similar strategy [end-example]. [Evidence] The specific observation of this report is that Leighton focuses its FM operations into specific areas in which its group of companies has expertise, in particular in construction, telecommunications and mining (Leighton Constractors Pty Ltd 2009) [end-evidence]. [Link] This is a key observation as it affirms PICA\u2019s expressed desire to enter FM by leveraging its expertise in Strata Management [end-link].   Narration:   None.   [slide 21: Persuading the reader]   Description:   Grid of icons accompanying the following text:   - Strong topic sentence   - Introduction and summaries for each section   - Effective evaluation and analysis   - Integration of sources to support your view   Narration:   In a business research report your goal is to persuade the reader to follow your advice. Therefore, it is essential that they believe your understanding of the market is thorough and well researched. The following strategies are useful for writing persuasively.   [slide 22: Strong topic sentence]   Description:   [Text examples]   - [underlined] Evolution consulting [end-underlined] recommends that PICA consider acquiring the Port Stevens Group.   - [underlined] The hypothesis [end-underlined] is that now is a good time for PICA to diversify into FM.   Narration:   Strong topic sentences reinforce your argument and help persuade the reader. Both topic sentences below have a clear direct message.   Notice how the topic sentence comes at the beginning of the sentence.   [slide 23: Introductions and conclusions for sections]   Description:   [Text]   Introduction to a section   It is the belief of the research team that the successful entry into the FM sector will require PICA to target a specific building sub-market.   Conclusion to a section   In a conclusion, from the analysis of overall market trends, PICA would benefit from targeting the residential building sub-market.   Narration:   Use section introduction and summaries to clearly state and restate your view. This acts as a reminder to the reader and emphasises the consistency   of your argument.   [slide 24: Effective evaluation and analysis]   Description:   [Text]   - Paragraph strategy   And   - Sentence strategy   Narration:   It is essential to write convincing evaluations of the strengths, weaknesses and risks. It is this understanding that makes it possible for the company to make decisions about future strategy.   [slide 25: Paragraph strategy]   Description:   A graphic illustrating the narration:   At the beginning of a paragraph, the topic sentence (evaluation of risk) should be first written. Followed by an explanation and analysis. Lastly, providing a solution. The language used in the process, should be formal impersonal language.   Narration:   Here are two useful writing strategies, which make your evaluation   and analysis more effective. They are firstly clear paragraph organization   and secondly use of a formal impersonal style.   [slide 26: Sentence strategy]   Description:   [Text]   Use tentative language   This demonstrates you have a thorough understanding of the level of risk.   - It is advised   - Is minimized   - Will be made   Use passive form   Write in an impersonal style. Suggest your view is based on research rather than opinion.   - Could, would, may, might   - There is a view that,   - There is a perception that   Language   Use active verbs   Narration:   In business writing it is generally better to write in a   clear and direct style. This includes using active verb forms.   However, when evaluating risks it is useful to write in a more   tentative and indirect style. Using tentative language shows you have a complex understanding of the situation and are aware of the degrees of risk.   It is also useful to write in an impersonal style as this gives your writing authority. It suggest that you are stating the views of the industry or other experts, and not just your own opinion. Passive verb forms generally weaken business writing as they are indirect. However, they are useful in evaluation as their use emphasises the advice itself rather than the voice of the writer.   [slide 27: Integration of sources]   Description:   [Text]   - Supports your view with evidence   - Demonstrates the strength of your research and sources   Narration:   No narration.   [slide 28: Referencing in sentences]   Description: Sentence 1:   [Source] ACIF (2013) [end-source] projects that recovery will continue to strengthen for NSW in 2014.   Sentence 2:   Recover of the construction sector will continue to strengthen for NSW in 2014 [source] (ACIF) [end-source]   Narration:   There are two ways to include references in a sentence at the beginning or at the end. The difference between these two constructions is subtle but it changes the focus of the sentence.   [slide 29: Effects and emphasis]   Description: Sentence 1:   Source prominent   - Source (ACIF) emphasized as topic   - Common in academic writing where the research itself can be the topic   Sentence 2:   Information prominent   - Recovery emphasized as topic   - Common in business writing   Narration:   This sentence emphasizes the source of the information and is common in academic writing. This does not emphasize the view of the student or writer. This sentence puts the information at the beginning of the sentence and emphasizes the writers view. This is useful if the writer wants to persuade the reader to follow his or her advice.   Business writing   [slide 30: Topic slide]   [slide 31: Academic writing and business writing]  Description: Academic  Purpose:   Knowledge and research   Audience:   Lecturer   Writing:   - Expected structure   - Academic style   - Uses a range of sources  Business  Purpose:   Business decision-making and action   Audience:   Workplace \/ Industry   Writing:   - Expected structure   - Business style   - Uses sources with practical application   Narration:   There are differences between academic writing and business writing. In academic writing the overall focus is on knowledge and research. In business writing decision making and action are the goal. These differences are important and affect the writing style.   [slide 32: Tips for business writing]   Description:   Iconography for the following three points:   - Be direct: Darts board, aimed at the centre   - Be concise: Cutting out words (paper)   - Use strong active verbs: A man lifting up weights   Narration:   No narration.   [slide 33: Be direct]   Description:   Put the most important information first.  So people can easily find it.   Put the topic sentence at the beginning   [Example]   Whereas in the past, FM services were regarded as an overhead cost, the[emphasis] attitude towards FM services [end-emphasis]  have changed to now viewing these costs as life cycle costs (International Facilities Management Association 2011).   Versus.  [Emphasis] Attitudes towards FM services [end-emphasis] have changed from that of an overhead cost to a life cycle cost (International Facilities Management Association 2011).   Make it easy to read   Clear logical structure, headings, sub-headings and bullet points.   Narration:   People are busy and will read only minimally. Therefore, one very useful strategy in business writing is to put the most important information first,   so you know the audience will find it. Notice how the first sentence is more difficult to read. In the second sentence the topic is at the beginning of the sentence as this makes the point immediately clear to the reader.  [slide 34: Be concise]   Description: Cut out unnecessary words       Wordy phrases     Singular words       It is often the case that     Often       It is important to note that\u2026     Importantly       In the event that     If       Final completion     Completion       Consensus of opinion     Consensus       Summarise briefly     Summarise       Narration:   Use concise language by replacing wordy phrases with single words.   [slide 35: Use strong active verbs]   Description: Use strong active verbs   [Example 1]   ACIF [emphasis] believes [end-emphasis] that construction projects [emphasis] will experience [end-emphasis] considerable growth in 2014.   Versus   [Example 2]   ACIF [emphasis] forecasts [end-emphasis] considerable growth in residential construction investment in 2014.   Narration:   Strong active verbs convey a clear and remove the need for repetition.   [slide 36: Identify the weaknesses ]   Description: [Poor example]   In terms of non-residential construction projects ACIF (2013) expects that construction investments in NSW will be subject to a considerable growth rate, whereas investments in non-residential construction projects are expected to remain constant for all other region.   How this can be improved   Legend: [strikethrough] = Be concise. [Highlight] = be direct. [Emphasis] = Use strong active words.   [Strikethrough] in terms of [end-strikethrough] [highlight] non-residential [end-highlight] construction projects ACIF (2013) [emphasis] expects [end-emphasis] that [highlight] construction investments in NSW [end-highlight] will be [strikethrough] subject to a considerable growth rate [end-strikethrough] , whereas investments in non-residential construction projects [emphasis] are expected to [end-emphasis] remain constant for all other regions.   [Improved example]   In NSW, construction investment for non-residential projects will grow compared with other regions of Australia (ACIF 2013). \r\n\r\n","excerpt":"This page gives you an example report broken down into sections to provide a sample of how a report can be structured.

This page has some useful tips to help you improve your academic writing.\r\nYou need to vary the length of sentences in your paragraphs. This is important to add interest to your writing, readability, and to show relationships between ideas. Notice in the following example that all sentences are similar in length and structure. The ideas are not linked, making the writing disjointed.\r\nPoor example\r\nRecent changes in the sea, land and atmosphere have made it more difficult for animals and plants to sustain themselves. Derocher (2008), for example, claims that the ice cap in the Arctic is shrinking. This change constitutes a loss of feeding and breeding areas for polar bears. Polar bears are not alone in their loss of habitat. According to Walsh (2008) warming of the atmosphere in Costa Rica may have caused some species to become extinct. As the atmosphere gradually warms, they have nowhere to go and may eventually die out (Walsh 2008).

There are two stages in this process.\r\nFirst stage\r\nLook at the structure of the text, e.g. the Table of Contents, the Abstract, headings and sub-headings, to see if the text is suitable for your purpose. This will help you to locate relevant research quickly.\r\nSecond stage\r\nIf the text appears to be relevant for your purposes, then you can read it in-depth to find specific research to support your literature review.\r\n\r\nThese techniques enable you to identify appropriate material by reading widely and to gain a broad understanding of the available literature on your topic.\r\nObjectivity\r\nYou must be objective in your research. Remember the reason you are reading is to be able to give an evaluation and critique of the literature chosen. Do not just select the parts of the literature that agree with what you think is right.\r\n\r\nStep 2 - evaluating your reading\r\n\r\nIt is important to critically evaluate your readings to establish their relevance and credibility for your research topic. After all, you are basing your theoretical framework and your literature review on what you have read.\r\n\r\nYou can find a checklist of critical questions to keep in mind when you evaluate your readings.\r\n\r\nStep 3 - summarising, analysing and organising your readings\r\n\r\nIt is important that you make notes as you read. You should think about and include the following in your notes.\r\n\r\n \tThe main points\/theories\/key issues raised in the text, e.g. book or article.\r\n \tDetails of any quotes, or page references that you think may be good to use in your literature review.\r\n \tAll bibliographic information, e.g. author, date, title of book, publisher\/journal, page numbers, etc. For further information see guidelines for presentation of written work.\r\n \tThe author's stated or implied purpose.\r\n \tThe conclusions the author has made.\r\n \tThe points that support the conclusions.\r\n\r\nIt is also useful to write down your own thoughts on\/about your readings. This will help you when you start to write.\r\n\r\nStep 4 - analysing and organising your summaries and notes\r\n\r\nUse your summaries and notes to identify relationships and links in the research literature.\r\n\r\nYou should now be able to identify:\r\n\r\n \tThe similarities and differences between various authors and their research.\r\n \tWhat research agrees and disagrees?\r\n \tWhat major questions remain unanswered?\r\n \tWhat are the possible directions for future research?\r\n\r\nOrganising your summary\r\nTo organise your research, cluster similar research together, e.g., what information is similar or different.

In it, you present an argument based on evidence and your analysis of relevant theory and research.\r\n\r\nFirst steps\r\nCarefully read and analyse the essay topic and identify the key words. Generally, essay topics are made up of content, instruction and limiting words. Let's take a look at what each of these mean.\r\nContent words\r\nContent words tell you WHAT the topic is. They tell you which concepts the essay should be based around. They will often be words that you have encountered in your course, and by identifying them, you can have a good idea of what areas to review for your assignment. \r\nHere are some examples of essay prompts with content words italicised:\r\n\r\nExplain the process of photosynthesis in plants. Include the basic steps of chlorophyll.\r\nAnalyse the concept of democracy. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of representative democracy compared to direct democracy.\r\n\r\nInstruction words\r\nThese tell you HOW to write the essay. To identify them, look for the key verb or verbs in the topic.\r\nFor example, assignments may require you to:\r\n\r\ninvestigate an issue\r\nexplain the relationship between topics or ideas\r\ndescribe or explain a process\r\nargue a point of view.\r\n\r\nLimiting words \r\nThese words restrict the task. They set the scope of the topic and narrow down the topic area. Limiting words indicate the aspects of the topic that should be\r\nincluded and the boundaries of your discussion.\r\n\r\nFor example, an essay topic like \"Investigate the causes of pollution\" is a very broad topic. Your teacher might limit the scope of the topic by focusing on a particular type of pollution, and a specific place and\/or time period. To illustrate: \"Investigate the causes of water pollution in Melbourne, Australia in the last five years.\"\r\nRead the assessment criteria\r\nOnce you have broken down the question to understand what you have been asked to do, it is important to read the assignment brief in full. This way, you will discover any conditions that you need to follow, such as:\r\n\r\nword count\r\nrequired fonts and spacing\r\nthe required referencing style\r\nthe assignment due date.\r\nAlso, read the assignment rubric thouroughly. This tells you how your assignment will be graded and how the person marking your work will be assessing your essay. By having an understanding of this information, you can make sure that you include all of the required elements of the assignment in your work.\r\nSample essay topic\r\nThe following essay topic has been broken down into content words, instructional words and limiting words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow do I structure an essay? Essays have three parts: A beginning... A middle... and an end. That is, the introduction, body, and conclusion. It's important to have structure in your essay, or you will lose the flow of your argument.\r\n\r\nHow do I write an essay introduction? Writing an essay introduction can sometimes be quite challenging. It helps to break down your introduction into three important parts: First, start by introducing your topic. Then, state your argument. And finally, outline your main points.\r\n\r\nBy doing this, your introduction should start broad and become more specific, focusing in on your essay topic. Basically, you're letting the reader know what you're going to discuss throughout the essay. Let's have a look at this introduction as an example:\r\n\r\nSelf-confidence means possessing a positive, yet realistic, view of one's self and abilities. Self-confident people have trust and faith in their abilities. Self-confidence can be affected by a variety of factors. This essay will argue that self-confidence develops through a complex interaction between a range of factors. The essay will firstly define self-confidence, and then analyse the interaction between various factors that affect the confidence of an individual. In particular, these are personality style, situational factors\/life experiences self-efficacy and self-esteem.\r\n\r\nNotice the structure: The topic and context at the start of the paragraph; the argument in the middle, and what will be covered in the essay at the end of the paragraph.\r\n\r\nHow do I write an essay body? An essay body is a series of paragraphs that support the main argument.\r\n\r\nHow do I write an essay conclusion? Your essay conclusion is written in the opposite way to the introduction: it starts narrow and becomes broad. Begin with the detail of the essay, and expand out to the bigger picture. Here's an example of how to structure a conclusion:\r\n\r\nSelf-confidence is not ingrained within individuals and can be influenced by a variety of factors. The personality style of an individual can determine whether the individual is an introvert or an extrovert, which will affect self-confidence. Life experiences and situational factors have a large impact on the stability of personalities and confidence. Self-efficacy and self-esteem are major factors that can contribute to a lack of self-confidence. Self-confidence is essential for effective and positive engagement in all professional and personal activities.\r\n\r\nFor more information about essay writing, try the tutorials.\r\n\r\nThanks for watching.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"An essay is a discussion in response to a question or statement.

In this system, voters rank candidates in order of preference on their ballots, instead of picking just one (Liu, 2024). , if no candidate gets more than half of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the least votes is removed. , their votes are given to the next preferred candidate on those ballots. , this process helps to ensure that the winning candidate has wider support among voters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne factor within the team that seems to be important is the notion of team cohesiveness. , team cohesiveness enables a diverse group of individuals to work towards common goals. Maxwell (2011, p.107) argues that highly cohesive teams \u2018have clear goals and successful outcomes\u2019. , cohesive teams are more likely to work well together, have enthusiasm for their work (Brown 2009) and so achieve a high rate of success (Zheng &amp; Hui 2008). , team cohesiveness has been shown to enhance team effectiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many ways people can improve their spelling. However, knowing a few simple spelling rules can help to improve your spelling.\r\nAccurate spelling helps effective communication. To develop a professional level of communication, both for your studies and professional life after graduation, it is important to address spelling at the proofreading stage of assignment writing.\r\n\r\nIncorrect spelling can distract the reader from the point you are trying to make. With spell-check facilities on your computer and easy access to on-line dictionaries, you can take steps to eliminate spelling errors. There are also strategies you can use to improve your spelling more generally.\r\nPreferred spelling\r\nMost lecturers expect that you will use standard Australian English spelling. As you research widely, you are likely to come across other forms of spelling, including American English spelling. While some lecturers accept American spelling, others require standard Australian spelling. Both these group agree, however, that it is important to be consistent with your spelling throughout your assignment. To assist with this, set the language option on your computer to English (Australian).\r\n\r\nThe difference between standard Australian and American spellings is minimal and usually does not affect the reader\u2019s ability to understand what you have written. N.B. Some organisation names use the American style, e.g. World Health Organization.\r\nDictionaries\r\nTo improve your spelling and expand your academic vocabulary, you should access the largest and best dictionaries you can; a pocket dictionary may be cheaper and easy to carry around but is unlike to have the range of words you need.

Use the study tips on this page to become familiar with this language style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same way that recipes or letters use a particular style and form of language, academic assignments usually follow a particular style. Here are some guidelines.\r\nBe specific\r\nTo write in a precise way:\r\n\r\n \tuse specific examples to illustrate your points\r\n \tcut out anything that is not necessary to the point you are making \u2013 re-reading and editing your work to refine it can help with this\r\n \task other people to read your work to look for any irrelevant or vague content\r\n\r\nUse the terminology of your subject or discipline and be clear about what you are saying. Don\u2019t assume that a tutor will simply know what you mean. When you really know your subject you should be able to articulate the main ideas and explain the main terms to someone who hasn\u2019t studied in your area.\r\n\r\nTo build your subject vocabulary:\r\n\r\n \tkeep your own glossary (list) of subject words at the back of a folder\r\n \tdevelop a list of \u2018power\u2019 words, ones that say a lot succinctly: e.g. \u2018nocturnal\u2019 is a more precise word for \u2018is active at night\u2019\r\n \tuse a thesaurus and a subject-specific dictionary\r\n\r\nBe tentative\r\nAcademic writing is cautious in presenting findings. Most theories are open to some modification.\r\n\r\nTo indicate new and emerging research, use words or phrases such as:\r\n\r\n \t\u2026suggests that\r\n \tThere is a possibility that\u2026\r\n \tStudies indicate that\u2026\r\n \tIt would seem that\u2026\r\n\r\nFor knowledge that is more established, use:\r\n\r\n \t\u2026 it is probable\u2026\r\n \tthe majority of\u2026\r\n \tThere is a tendency for\u2026,\r\n \tRecent studies confirm\u2026\r\n\r\nFor example: Mahlab (1994) suggests that there are significant differences in communication.\r\nUse impersonal language\r\nYou are often asked to make judgements and include your own views on an issue. However, in most subject areas you are required to avoid the pronoun \u2018I\u2019.\r\nThe fact that you are not reporting another person\u2019s view implies that the view is your own. In fact, whatever is included in your essay that is not attributed to someone else, [i.e. Jones (1987) demonstrates that\u2026, according to Smith (1994)...] is assumed to be yours.\r\nFor example, instead of saying \u2018I think that all guns should be banned\u2019 you can say \u2018strict government control of guns is required\u2019.\r\n\r\nUse formal language\r\nA university assignment requires a more formal type of language. Allow plenty of time to revise your expression after you have composed the main content.\r\nYou need to:\r\n\r\n\r\n \tAvoid slang, which is a very informal way of speaking or writing particular to a specific group of people (e.g. \u2018cool\u2019) and language that is too casual (e.g. \u2018pretty awful\u2019).\r\n \tUse full forms rather than abbreviations (e.g. 'does not' rather than 'doesn\u2019t').\r\n \tConsider the use of nominalisation, which is making noun structures, (e.g. \u2018comprehension is aided by repetition\u2019 rather than \u2018you can understand something better if it is repeated\u2019).\r\n\r\nBe careful: too much nominalisation can make your writing unnecessarily complex and tedious to read.\r\n\r\nUse strong reporting words\r\nWhen you use other people\u2019s research you can give it extra significance by using a more precise reporting word, e.g. \u2018Jacob (1998) concedes that the test is not 100% reliable.\u2019 is more powerful than \u2018Jacob says that...\u2019\r\nUseful reporting words include:\r\n\r\nclaim, describe, outline, examine, discuss, state, suggest, observe, identify, consider, assert, propose, contend, support, recommend, purport, dismiss, refute, dispute, contradict, disagree, concur, point out, show, confirm, demonstrate, attribute\u2026to, calculate, contend, argue, reveal, maintain\r\nNB: The more you read academic material, the faster you will pick up the appropriate academic style, and the more academic reporting words you will acquire.\r\n\r\nUse your own \u2018voice\u2019\r\nYour assignment should be in your own words to reflect your thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n \tIf you rely too much on quotes from different sources, your assignment task may lack cohesion and unity of style.\r\n \tMake your own paraphrases and summaries of research\r\n \tIf English is not your first language, ask someone to read your assignments before you submit them, but don\u2019t be afraid to use your own \u2018voice\u2019.\r\n\r\nWrite clearly\r\nGood writing is achieved by balancing a number of attributes. Sometimes it is necessary to sacrifice a little of one to achieve another. This tutorial gives you strategies for writing clearly in an academic style.\r\nThe goal is clarity - is your meaning clear?\r\n\r\nCommunicating complex ideas does not require complex writing. Good academic writing is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCoherent\r\nThere is a clear sense of unity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCohesive\r\nThe ideas flow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConcise\r\nIt gets straight to the point\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result is clear writing which the reader can easily understand. \r\n\r\nStudents are often told by their lecturers that they need to write their assignments in a more academic style. But what does this mean? The academic style is characterised by several features that makes it very different from speech-like writing or journalistic writing.\r\n\r\nOne of the main features of the writing is that it is more formal. Formal language means that you must use full words in your writing. When we speak, we use contractions such as \"don't\" and \"doesn't\" and \"can't\". When we write, we must use the full version and write \"do not\", \"does not\" or \"cannot\". Personal pronouns such as\u00a0 \"I\", \"we\", or \"you\" are rarely used. And, of course, you should never use slang.\r\n\r\nUsing tentative language in your writing. Another feature of academic style is the use of tentative language. This is when you write about something without 100 percent certainty, leaving room for doubt. You should use words such as \"tends to\"... \"suggests that\"... and \"appears to\".\r\n\r\nAlso, be concise in your writing. Use one word instead of lots of words to say the same thing.\r\n\r\nFinally, be specific! Choose the best words for your meaning. Like in this example, the word students is more specific than people. Look at this example and think about how it could be rewritten in a more academic style:\r\n\r\nWorked example: In recent times, there have been more people coming to Australia because life is tough, and these people come from places in close proximity to wars. At this moment in time, I think it's really bad for them here if they want to work in low level jobs and don't have skills or qualifications. I think it's really because the jobs in factories that these people used to do are not around as much.\r\n\r\nPossible version: There has been increased migration to Australia due to poverty and war overseas. Traditionally, many new migrants work in unskilled employment in order to establish themselves. Currently, it appears that unskilled low wage workers have particularly suffered due to a decline in the availability of unskilled employment.\r\n\r\nThanks for watching.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Students are frequently required to use academic style for their university assignments.

It may change like the variable, (both doubling) or it may change more, or less. Differentiation means finding the derivative of an expression.\r\nThis means you are finding a rate of change for a variable. It expresses the slope of the curve.\r\n\r\nThe derivative of velocity with respect to time is acceleration. If you map the profit of a company over time, the derivative will tell you if the company is getting stronger, levelling off or heading backwards.\r\n\r\nReview these sections to learn about this field of mathematics\r\n\r\n \tD1 Limit of a function\r\nThe limit of a function means finding the value of a curve at a particular point. But what is that point? A value to many decimal places can be very long, to define a value that is very precise. The precise point can be infinitely small.We can only ask what the value of the curve is as we get closer to that point, from values above and from values below. That is what we mean by approaching the limit.\r\n \tD2 Gradients, tangents and derivatives\r\nA tangent is a line that touches a curve at only one point. Where that point sits along the function curve, determines the slope (i.e. the gradient) of the tangent to that point. (See also Functions and graphs)A derivative of a function gives you the gradient of a tangent at a certain point on a curve. If you plug the x value into the derivative function, you will get the slope of the tangent at that point, defined by the x value. Practice evaluating the gradients of these tangents to a curve.\r\n \tD3 Differentiation from first principles\r\nLearn how to take a derivative of a function using first principles. Using this method is the best way to understand the concepts around differentiation. Start here to really appreciate what you are doing when you differentiate, before you start differentiating using other methods in later modules.\r\n \tD4 Rules for differentiation\r\nLearn about the rules for differentiation and the different notations that are used. This section includes algebraic, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric examples.\r\n \tD5 The chain rule\r\nHow do you differentiate a larger function that has components that are smaller functions? This module will show you how to package these functions and work them out separately, before plugging them into the Chain Rule formula.\r\n \tD6 The product rule\r\nWhat is the product rule? It is useful when you want to differentiate a function that comprises one function multiplied by another function.\r\n \tD7 Quotient ruleWhat is the quotient rule? The quotient rule is like the product rule but this time it is for one function that is divided by another (rather than multiplied).\r\nReview this section to learn how to differentiate using the quotient rule.\r\n \tD8 Maxima and minima\r\nHow do you find the maximum (highest) or minimum (lowest) value of a curve? The maximum or minimum values of a function occur where the derivative is zero. That is where the graph of the function has a horizontal tangent. If you go looking for the horizontal tangents (i.e. where the derivative = 0), you will be able to pinpoint the maxima or minima of a curve.\r\n \tD9 Curve sketching\r\nIf you find some key points of a function such as: maxima, minima, or turning points; x and y axis intercepts; and regions where the gradient is positive or negative, you can put together a sketch of a curve. Read this section to find examples of this being done.\r\n \tD10 Rates of change\r\nIf there is a relationship between two or more variables (like, area and radius of a circle (A = \u03c0r2 ), or pressure, volume and temperature of a gas), then there will also be a relationship between how these variables change. You may need to find how fast one variable changes in relation to another variable that is changing. This is called the rate of change.\r\nThis page presents such examples to help you turn a worded question into a mathematical solution.\r\n \tD11 Small changes and approximations\r\nSometimes a small change in one variable can render a big change in a larger value. For example, a small increase (or error) in the radius of a sphere means a lot more volume is added!\r\nIf you estimate the small error in one variable, you can calculate the significant change in a larger variable by using derivatives.\r\n \tD12 Implicit differentiation\r\nWhat is implicit differentiation? How do you differentiate a function (say y=) that has two different variables in it (say x and k)? What do you do when you cannot express one as a function of the other? The technique of implicit differentiation is then useful.Implicit differentiation enables you to find the derivative of y with respect to x without having to solve the original equation for y (see also Rearranging formula). Implicit differentiation may require using the Chain rule and Product Rule together.Read this sheet for some worked examples and exercises in this process.\r\n \tD13 Partial differentiation\r\nWhat is partial differentiation? You may have an expression with 3 variables or more. The volume (V) of a cylinder for example depends on radius(r.) and height(h).It makes it easier to hold one value as constant and differentiate with respect to the other two. This helps us to see how the change in one impacts the change in the other, without being muddled by the third variable.Partial derivatives reveal how a function with many variables changes when you adjust just one of the variables in the input.\r\n \tD14 Higher order derivatives\r\nHigher derivatives are used in many mathematical, scientific and engineering subjects.\r\n \tD15 Logarithmic differentiation\r\nSometimes it is easier to differentiate the logarithm of a function than the original function. This is called logarithmic differentiation and this module provides an overview of the method and provides some examples.\r\n","excerpt":"The value of a function changes when one of the variables (x, y, a, or b etc) changes.

If you're not sure, start with something small that you can do in a short amount of time like a week or a few days.\r\n\r\nFor example: \"I will start and finish my literature review\" is not a good SMART goal because it is too general.\r\n\r\nA more achievable and SMART way to approach the assignment would be to divide it into small tasks and give each task a deadline. For example, you might set the goal of reading and summarising three articles by the end of the day. This goal is very specific, it's limited to a short time period, it's attainable, it's relevant to your assignment and you can clearly identify at the end the day whether you have been successful.\r\n\r\nThen, once you have completed this task, you will feel that you have achieved something and you can start your next attainable task feeling confident that you will be able to get it done.\r\nPriorities\r\nThere are a number of techniques that can be used to prioritise tasks- this section will focus on the Eisenhower Matrix. This is a model used to the importance and urgency of tasks to help priorite when and how they should be completed.\r\nTo use the matrix, organise your tasks into four categories: \r\n\r\nUrgent and important: Tasks like assignments due soon or exam preparation. These should be focused on first. \r\nImportant but NOT urgent: Long-term projects or ongoing study. Schedule regular time for these tasks to avoid last-minute stress.\r\nUrgent but NOT important: These include Interruptions like phone calls or messages that aren't critical and responding to non-essential emails. Limit time spent on these and fit them around more important tasks.\r\nNeither urgent nor important: Activities such as scrolling social media, watching movies and playing video games. Minimise or schedule these for downtime.\r\nActive learning\r\nThis short video explains what you need to become a successful and efficient learner. It covers concepts such as knowing your own learning style, what independent learning is, and gives you ideas and strategies on how to be successful in your studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Do you run out of time when you are studying? The key is to learn efficiently. This doesn't just happen in SWOTVAC, it is a process that begins early in the semester.\r\n\r\nYou need to have some learning strategies and develop some learning skills. You need to learn independently; you need to be proactive. This means finding answers to things you do not know, and being aware of what you do not know in the first place.\r\n\r\nYou need to be efficient, so that you are not going over and over the same material. You do this by using active learning strategies and knowing your learning style. This means understanding how you yourself learn best.\r\n\r\nOrganise your notes and you to-do list into categories. A long, long list is scary, and the most important things can get lost. Sorting things into groups is the brain's natural way of remembering.\r\n\r\nAnother tip is to use active learning strategies. Reading and listening is okay, but you will only remember 20 to 30 per cent of the information. It tends to go in one ear and out the other. Writing, speaking, and even teaching a concept to someone else is much more effective. So, by all means, chat with classmates about the material, take notes, and make your own summaries. These are all active learning strategies.\r\n\r\nIt also helps to know your own learning style, so you can use strategies that suit you. If your learning style is visual, you should try drawing stuff to understand and remember things. Some people learn best by doing, so hands on activities help them to learn. Explaining things to others really helps [auditory learners] absorb information themselves.\r\n\r\nThe most important strategy, of course, is to take charge yourself, because no one's going to do it for you. There is support there if you need it, but you will need to seek that help yourself. Your lecturers, the website, the Learning Lab, the Study and Learning Centre, and the library are all there to help you achieve your best, but when it comes to your study, you are now the boss.","excerpt":"Check out these tips for managing your time and keeping on track with your assessments.

To successfully organise your time you need to work out how much time is available and how you can best use this time. There are several useful techniques that will help you plan your time.\r\nAssignment Planner\r\nThe RMIT Library has a great assignment planning tool that is easy to use and provides you with step-by-step plan, withs links to lots of resources to help you stay on task.\r\nOnline calendars\r\nMicrosoft Outlook is available to RMIT students and includes an online calendar which can help you organise both your day-to-day activities and your entire semester.\r\n\r\nMap out your semester: With the Outlook calendar, you can easily input all your assignment due dates and exam schedules. The calendar can be viewed by month, week, or day, allowing you to see both the big picture and the finer details.\r\n\r\nPlan your days:\u00a0Use the daily view to schedule your study sessions, classes, and personal commitments. This helps ensure that you allocate enough time for each task and avoid last-minute cramming.\r\n\r\nSet reminders:\u00a0Customise your reminder settings to receive notifications well in advance of deadlines. You can set reminders to alert you a month, a week, or just 15 minutes before a task is due, helping you stay on top of your responsibilities.\r\n\r\nCollaborate with classmates:\u00a0For group assignments, you can share your calendar with your classmates. This feature makes it easy to coordinate meeting times and ensure everyone is on the same page. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to your studies, it really pays off to stay organised throughout the semester. One method for keeping on top of your homework, assignments, and exam study is to use a planner. At RMIT, free semester planners are available at the Study and Learning Centre.\r\n\r\nTo use your planner effectively, it\u2019s a good idea to write down important dates, such as assignment deadlines, milestones, and dates of tests and quizzes. Another method is to use your student diary to plan your study. Or, if you prefer, the RMIT Learning Lab offers a weekly study timetable that you can fill out online and then print.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself not getting much done during study sessions, try setting yourself goals. Break down an assignment into small, achievable tasks, and each time you complete a goal, reward yourself. A 3000-word essay can seem a bit overwhelming at first. But if you break down the assignment into small goals during your study sessions, such as \u201cWrite 500 words\u201d, or \u201cWrite introduction\u201d, this makes the assignment much more manageable.\r\n\r\nRemember, focus first on the assignments that are worth the most marks. Have a look at the subject\u2019s course guide for a breakdown of assessment marks.\r\n\r\nGoogle Calendar is another good tool to use to stay on top of your studies. You can add important dates and set yourself reminders. This way, you\u2019ll receive automatic notifications on all of your devices. Download the RMIT \u201cImportant Dates\u201d calendar, which imports important dates such as week numbers, census dates, graduation dates, and so on.\r\n\r\nFor more information about time management, try the tutorial.

For this, your marker will consider things like your voice, your body language and gestures, your slides and your engagement with the audience. Here are some tips for maximising your marks for delivery.\r\n\r\nVisit the space before your presentation\r\nIf you're unfamiliar with the presentation venue, try to visit it before the day of your presentation. This allows you to decide where to stand so you don't block the slides and where you can maintain eye contact with the entire audience, not just the teacher. \r\n\r\nIt's also a good opportunity to test the room's technology to prevent any surprises on the day.\r\n\r\nFace your audience\r\nIt can be tempting to turn around and read from your slides, but this should be avoided. Everytime you turn your back on your audience, you break the engagement. This is why positioning yourself to the side of your slides and making hand gestures to important points is preferred. \r\n\r\nAlso, having fewer words on your slides will reduce the temptation to read from them. \r\n\r\nUse your voice\r\nThe voice we use when giving presentations should be different from our normal speech. When presenting, we shoud:\r\n\r\n\tSlow down: This will improve the clarity of your voice by allowing you to focus more on pronunciation and it gives the audience more time to process what you are telling them.\r\n\tProject: This means speaking more loudly than you usually would so that everyone in the room can hear you clearly.\r\n\r\n\tEmphasise\r\nBy using emphasis, you put a stress on key words and concepts, which will make them stand out more for your audience. For example, the following came from a presentation that a students gave on deforestation.\r\n\r\nIn this example, the emphasised words are in bold:\r\n\"Deforestation is a major issue because it leads to the loss of biodiversity and contributes significantly to climate change.\"\r\n\r\nBody language\r\nA good posture and positive body language tells your audience that you are confident, interested and excited about what you have to say. On the other hand, if you have closed body language and do not seem interested in your topic, it will be hard for your audience to be engaged. \r\n\r\nWhere possible, try to maintain good posture, give eye contact to each person in the room and use hand gestures that complement your talk. For example, you can signal to key points in your slides or to emphasise certain key words.\r\n\r\nAvoid crossing your arms, looking at the ground, turning your back to the audience and only focusing on one section of the audience.\r\n\r\nPractice\r\nIf you want to build up your confidence before a talk, then you should know your topic inside and out. Here are some tips for getting prepared:\r\n\r\n\tRehearse your talk a number of times and time yourself. When you know your talk well, you will deliver it well.\r\n\tPractise with a friend or family member and get feedback from them.\r\n\tPractise delivering your talk using the main points and brief notes only on cue cards. It is important that you know your topic thoroughly so that you can deliver your presentation confidently.\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"Part of the mark you receive for your presentation will be given for the way your information is delivered.

The following strategies can help make a talk more interesting.\r\n\r\nVoice techniques\r\nYour presentation should contain the rise and fall of oral speech rather than the monotonous drone of reading out loud. Speakers use voice techniques to emphasise the introduction of new and important ideas.\r\n\r\nThe main techniques used are:\r\n\r\n \tword stress (words spoken more slowly and loudly). During the presentation you need to speak clearly and try not to talk too fast. When you are nervous you tend to talk faster than usual. In fact, speaking slowly alleviates nerves and gives you time to collect your thoughts.\r\n \tTone and pitch (the rise and fall of the speech). Vary the stress, volume and tone.\r\n \tSpeed\/pace remember to slow down the speed of your speaking - slower speech alleviates nervousness.\r\n\r\nObserve how Christine uses voice techniques to emphasise the introduction of new and important\u00a0ideas.\r\n\r\nUse of visuals\r\nVisual aids can add another dimension to an oral presentation and strengthen the listeners' comprehension.\r\n\r\nMake your talk interesting by using well designed, colourful and self explanatory visuals such as:\r\n\r\n \tpictures\r\n \tdiagrams\r\n \tcharts\r\n \tgraphs.\r\n\r\nNotice how Christine:\r\n\r\n \tvaries her voice for emphasis\r\n \tuses facial expressions to involve the audience\r\n \tuses gestures and movements to add to the meaning of her talk\r\n \tuses eye contact to keep the audience interested\r\n \tuses visual aids to add to her talk.\r\n\r\n\r\nBody language and posture\r\nYour posture should be tall and straight not slumped, as this assists in relaxation and your breathing control. An open stance helps voice control and projection as well as presenting a confident and trusting image to your audience.\r\n\r\nUse gestures to emphasise main points and facial expressions to enhance meaning. Move naturally and keep eye contact.\r\n\r\nUse of cards\r\nCreate an outline of your presentation in note form to prompt you as you speak.

I'm here this afternoon to provide you with a student's perspective of the Learning Lab website. (personalised opening)\r\n\r\nAfter viewing the site, I feel that it will be of great benefit to not only students, but also to lecturers and other university staff. The website is user friendly as it is easy to navigate, providing answers to questions that I imagine lecturers and university librarians must be faced with on a regular basis. This is a resource that lecturers, librarians and student mentoring groups such as SLAMS can refer students to. (Introduces topic)\r\n\r\nThe website consists of six links: There's the study skills link which includes note-taking skills, referencing and time management. Writing skills, which includes tips on how to summarise and paraphrase. There is also the assessment task section which includes tips on how to go about completing assessment tasks. Maths essentials-which provides some revision of basic mathematical concepts that may have been forgotten since leaving high school. There is also a link outlining different types of on-campus student services; and also a place to submit any queries online.(visual aids-points to screen)\r\n\r\nSince* I am undertaking my Honours year, research is a major component of my program, so it's great to have a site that offers online tutorials on how to reference and footnote different resources, literally at my fingertips. I know that many students are still confused about how to reference and which style of referencing RMIT accepts. This site goes through all these skills step by step in an easy manner.(linking*\/uses cue cards) (eye contact, personalises)\r\n\r\nIn the assessment tasks section* of the site, it shows students how to complete assessment tasks such as essays, reports and literature reviews. There are some students that wouldn't even know how to begin to complete these tasks. Particularly for international students, where English is their second language, this may prove to be especially difficult. The Learning Lab website goes through the definition of the assessment task and walks the student through exactly what is expected of them and how to go about completing it.(linking words*) (speaks to a specific group)\r\n\r\nOne of the most useful skills* taught on the site is how to go about revising and preparing for exams. I know for a fact that many students perceive exams as a big memory test-cramming everything in the week before the exam. However, this site teaches students how to go about practising good study skills, so that they learn to study on a regular basis, which makes the process of preparing for the end-of-semester exam a whole lot easier.(linking words*) (uses cards, personalises)\r\n\r\nWhat I like about this website* is how it sets out basic fundamentals that every student should know, but may be too embarassed to ask. Sometimes when students reach university level, they don't feel that they should be asking because it's already expected of them to know all this. However, by publicising the site to students, they will always have a site to go to if they are unsure of anything.(linking words*\/smiles\/personalises)\r\n\r\nFurthermore*, since all of this is readily available online, students do not need to bother lecturers with these sorts of queries, leaving them more time to assist students with queries relating to materials being taught.

The following strategies can help make a talk more interesting. Voice techniques Your presentation should contain the rise and fall of oral speech rather than the monotonous drone of reading out loud. Speakers use voice techniques to emphasise the introduction of new and important ideas. The main techniques used are: word stress (words spoken more slowly and loudly). During the presentation you need to speak clearly and try not to talk too fast.
